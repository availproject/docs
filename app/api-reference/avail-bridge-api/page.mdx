# Avail bridge API reference

<Callout type="info">
**BEFORE WE START**<br/>
1. The Avail VectorX bridge can be used to pass messages and tokens between \
Avail DA Turing - Ethereum Sepolia (testnet bridge),
and between Avail DA mainnet - Ethereum mainnet (mainnet bridge).
2. You can check out a complete list of endpoints required to use the bridge API in the [networks page](/docs/networks#for-devs).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**TWO WAYS OF USING THE BRIDGE API**<br/>
1. You can build and run the bridge API locally using the instructions outlined in this repo:
[availproject/bridge-api](https://github.com/availproject/bridge-api)
2. We have included two public endpoints for the bridge API in the [networks page](/docs/networks#for-devs) that you can use.
For the sake of simplicity that is what we will be using in this guide.
3. For the sake of simplicity, we will use the Turing testnet bridge API in this guide.
</Callout>

## Setting up the dev environment


<Tabs items={['CURL', 'avail-rust']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. To use the Avail bridge API with `curl`, you just need to have `curl` installed on your system. 
You can check if it is installed by running:

```bash filename="CURL"
curl --version
```

2. If this does not work, go to [curl's website](https://curl.se/) to install it on your system.

1. Make sure `rust` and cargo are installed on your system. You can refer to [Rustlang's docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the same.

2. Create a new Rust project by running `cargo init`.

3. Paste the following into your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[package]
name = "avail_bridge_tools"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]

```

4. Create a `config.toml` file in the root of your project and paste the following:

```toml
avail_rpc_url="wss://turing-rpc.avail.so/ws"
avail_mnemonic = "A seed phrase for an Avail DA wallet"
ethereum_mnemonic = "A seed phrase for an Ethereum wallet"

# testnet bridge API
bridge_api_url="https://turing-bridge-api.avail.so/"
# Ethereum sepolia public node URL
ethereum_url="https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com"

# Sepolia bridge contract address
contract_address= "967F7DdC4ec508462231849AE81eeaa68Ad01389"
message_data= "Random data to send"
amount_to_send= 1000000

# Enter a Sepolia recipient address
