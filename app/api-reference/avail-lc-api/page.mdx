# Avail light client API reference

<Callout type="info">
**BEFORE WE START**<br/>
1. The Avail light client(Avail LC) can run in two modes: `Light-client` or `App-client`. We internally maintain
a light client instance available for public use running in the `Light-client` mode. Thus, for all methods that can
be called via an LC running in the `Light-client` mode, devs can use our public endpoint.
2. For methods that require an LC running in the `App-client` mode, you will need to run a local instance of the Avail LC.
3. You can check out or docs for [instructions on running your own instance
of the Avail light client](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-light-client/0010-light-client)
4. The LC API is exposed by default through `localhost:7007` by default.

## Setting up the dev environment

Set up your dev environment with `curl` and `Rust`:

<Tabs items={['CURL', 'Rust']}>

1. To use the Avail light client API with `curl`, you just need to have `curl` installed on your system. 
You can check if it is installed by running:

```sh
curl --version
```

2. If this does not work, go to [curl's website](https://curl.se/) to install it on your system.

How to run the Rust code snippets:

1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Cargo](https://crates.io/) installed on your system before moving forward. You can check that by running:
    ```sh
    rustc --version && cargo --version
    ```
    If either of these don't work, you can check out [Rust's official installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
     

1. Create a new Rust project:
    ```sh
    cargo new <project-name>
    ```
2. Add these dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    reqwest = { version = "0.12", features = ["json"] }
    serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
    serde_json = "1.0"
    tokio = { version = "1.36", features = ["full"] }
    base64 = "0.22"
    ```
3. Paste the code snippets into the `main.rs` file, and run the project with `cargo run`.
