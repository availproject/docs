<Callout type="info">
While the `SubscriptionID` generated by your Light Client is unique, and you need it to initially connect to the client,
you can use **ANY** [UUID4 number](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
as the `request_id` in your request.

*Sample Request:*

**HOW TO SUBMIT DATA USING THE LIGHT CLIENT?**<br/>
1. To use this method you need to run your Light Client in the `app-client` mode.
You can then submit data directly to the `appID` you configured while booting up the Light Client.

2. You can only pass `Base64` encoded data to be submitted via the Light Client.
You can use [this website](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode & decode your data into the required formats.
