# Submit data to Avail DA
<Callout type="info">
While the `SubscriptionID` generated by your Light Client is unique, and you need it to initially connect to the client,
you can use **ANY** [UUID4 number](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4)
as the `request_id` in your request.
</Callout>

*Sample Request:*

<Tabs items={['json']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```json
{"type":"submit","request_id":"4a482bb0-3c22-475d-a2b8-af1c27aa2636","message":{"data":"dGVzdAo="}}
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Callout type="info">
**HOW TO SUBMIT DATA USING THE LIGHT CLIENT?**<br/>
1. To use this method you need to run your Light Client in the `app-client` mode.
You can then submit data directly to the `appID` you configured while booting up the Light Client.

2. You can only pass `Base64` encoded data to be submitted via the Light Client.
You can use [this website](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode & decode your data into the required formats.
