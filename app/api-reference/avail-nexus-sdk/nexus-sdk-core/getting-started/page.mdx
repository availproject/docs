# Getting Started with the Avail Nexus SDK (Headless)

<Callout type="info">
**Headless SDK vs UI Widgets**<br/>

Go through this [page in our docs](/api-reference/avail-nexus-sdk) to decide which version of the SDK
is better suited for your use case.
</Callout>

<Callout>
The headless version of the Nexus SDK is designed to work with
any JavaScript based frontend environment as long as you can
inject a wallet provider into the SDK.
</Callout>

## Initialize the SDK

1. Import the SDK and initialize it with the network you want to use.
2. Inject the wallet provider into the SDK.
