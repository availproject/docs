# Avail node API reference

<Callout type="info">
**BEFORE WE START**<br/>
1. The Avail node supports an extensive list of extrinsics and various other types of calls that you can
[try out in our explorer](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/extrinsics).
2. This API reference currently documents only the most widely used extrinsics, but will be iterated upon
to eventually be an exhaustive resource for the Avail node API.

## Setting up the dev environment

1. Make sure `Node-js` is installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash filename="terminal"
node --version
```
If not installed, you can refer to [Node-js docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for the same.

2. Create a new Node-js project by running the following command in a directory of your choice:

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm init
```

3. To install the `avail-js-sdk` run the following command:

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm add avail-js-sdk@0.4.0
```

4. Make sure to install the `ts-node` package if you haven't already:

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm add -g ts-node
```

5. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project by running:

```bash filename="terminal"
touch tsconfig.json
```

6. Populate your `tsconfig.json` with the following configuration:

```json showLineNumbers filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "build",
    "declaration": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```

7. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project by running:

```bash filename="terminal"
pnpm add dotenv && touch .env
```

8. Put in the Seed Phrase of the account you want to use into the `.env` file:

```env showLineNumbers filename=".env"
SEED="This is a random seed phrase please replace with your own"
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="🔥">
**IMPORTANT**<br/>
1. Please be **VERY CAREFUL** with your seed phrase.
2. Make sure to add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` so that it doesn't get pushed anywhere.
3. While it is good enough to use an `env` file while testing, try to use better practices while deploying to production.
</Callout>

1. Make sure `rust` and cargo are installed on your system. You can refer to [Rustlang's docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the same.

2. Create a new Rust project by running `cargo init your-project-name`.

3. Paste the following into your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml showLineNumbers filename="Cargo.toml"
[workspace]

[package]
name = "your-project-name"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
# Use avail-rust v0.1.1 from the `avail-rust` repo
avail-rust = { git = "https://github.com/availproject/avail-rust", tag = "v0.1.1" }
# Tokio
tokio = { version = "1.38.0", features = ["full"] }
# dotenvy
dotenvy = "0.15.7"
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Check your rust version**<br/>
1. Run `rustc --version` to check the version of rust installed on your system.
2. Some features of the `avail-rust` SDK may not work with older versions of rust.
3. You can update the Rust version on your system by running `rustup update`.
