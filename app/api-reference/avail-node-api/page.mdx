# Avail node API reference

<Callout type="info">
**BEFORE WE START**<br/>
1. The Avail node supports an extensive list of extrinsics and various other types of calls that you can
[try out in our explorer](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/extrinsics).
2. This API reference currently documents only the most widely used extrinsics, but will be iterated upon
to eventually be an exhaustive resource for the Avail node API.

## Setting up the dev environment

<Tabs items={['avail-js', 'avail-deno', 'avail-rust', 'avail-go']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

1.  Make sure `Node-js` is installed on your system. You can refer to [Node-js docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for the same.

2. Create a new Node-js project by running `npm init -y` in a directory of your choice, and create a new file named `your-file-name.ts`

3. To install the `avail-js-sdk` run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install avail-js-sdk@0.3.0
```

4. Make sure to install the `ts-node` package if you haven't already:

```bash
npm i -g ts-node
```

5. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project and populate it:

```json showLineNumbers filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "build",
    "declaration": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Callout type="warning">
**AVAIL-DENO HAS BEEN SUNSET**<br/>
1. The `avail-deno` SDK has been sunset and will not be maintained or upgraded in the future.

2. We recommend you switch to `avail-js`. The SDK will work with `deno` out of the box. \
Just run `deno run --allow-net your-file-name.ts` to run your `avail-js` code with `deno`.
</Callout>

1. Make sure `avail-deno` is installed on your system. You can refer to [Deno's docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/) for the same.

2. Create a new Deno JS project by running `deno init` in a directory of your choice, and create a new file named `your-file-name.ts`
in the project.

3. The examples in this reference will interact with the Turing testnet of Avail DA, and will use the correspponding endpoint.
You can use the [networks page](/docs/networks) to find endpoints for mainnet if you need to.

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. Make sure `rust` and cargo are installed on your system. You can refer to [Rustlang's docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the same.

2. Create a new Rust project by running `cargo init your-project-name`.

3. Paste the following into your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml showLineNumbers filename="Cargo.toml"
[workspace]

[package]
name = "your-project-name"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
# Use avail-rust v0.1.1 from the `avail-rust` repo
avail-rust = { git = "https://github.com/availproject/avail-rust", tag = "v0.1.1" }
# Tokio
tokio = { version = "1.38.0", features = ["full"] }
# dotenvy
dotenvy = "0.15.7"
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Check your rust version**<br/>
1. Run `rustc --version` to check the version of rust installed on your system.
2. Some features of the `avail-rust` SDK may not work with older versions of rust.
3. You can update the Rust version on your system by running `rustup update`.
</Callout>

4. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and put in the Seed Phrase of the account you want to use:

```env showLineNumbers filename=".env"
SEED="This is a random seed phrase please replace with your own"
```

<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸ”¥">
**IMPORTANT**<br/>
1. Please be **VERY CAREFUL** with your seed phrase.
2. Make sure to add your `.env` file to your `.gitignore` so that it doesn't get pushed anywhere.
3. While it is good enough to use an `env` file while testing, try to use better practices while deploying to production.
</Callout>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. Make sure `go` is installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go version
```
If not installed, you can refer to [Go's docs](https://golang.org/doc/install) for the same.

2. Create a new Go project by initializing a Go module in a directory of your choice. Run the following command:

```bash
go mod init your-project-name
```

3. To install the avail-go-sdk, use the following command to add it to your project:

``` bash
go get github.com/availproject/avail-go-sdk@v0.1.1
```

4. Create a `config.json` file in the root of your project and fill it up like this:

```json showLineNumbers filename="config.json"
{
	"seed": "This is a random seed phrase please replace with your own",
	"api_url": "wss://turing-rpc.avail.so/ws",
	"size": 1000,
	"app_id": 0,
	"dest": "5H3qehpRTFiB3XwyTzYU43SpG7e8jW87vFug95fxdew76Vyi",
	"amount": 10
}
