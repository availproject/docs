# Avail API reference

This entire section is dedicated towards providing a detailed API reference for all of Avail's dev tooling.

We currently document the following APIs, feel free to reach out to us on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/AvailProject) if there are any error, or if something you need is missing:

1. `Avail node API`: The most comprehensive way of interacting with the Avail network programmatically.
2. `Avail light client API`: An easier way of interacting with the network and contributing to it's security.
3. `Avail bridge API`: Use the `VectorX` bridge programmatically to transfer tokens between Avail and Ethereum.
