# Manually submit an extrinsic to the network

<Callout type="info">
**WE RECOMMEND USING THE AVAIL SDKs DIRECTLY**<br/>
1. The `author_submitExtrinsic` RPC call is a low-level API that allows you to manually submit any extrinsic to the Avail network using a signed hash.
2. We recommend using our dedicated SDKs instead of using this RPC call directly for convenience.
3. The SDKs themselves use this RPC call internally, and offer a higher level of abstraction for interacting with the network.

<Callout type="info">
**KNOW THE DIFFERENCE**<br/>
1. `author_submitExtrinsic` & `author_submitAndWatchExtrinsic` are different RPC calls that serve different, but similar purposes.
2. We recommend not using the latter directly either. You can read about the problems with it [in this page in our docs](/da/api-reference/avail-node-api/author-submit-and-watch-extrinsic).
