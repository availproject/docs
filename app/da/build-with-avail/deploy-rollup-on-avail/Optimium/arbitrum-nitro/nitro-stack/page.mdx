# Deploy Arbitrum Orbit with Avail DA

This guide follows the deployment of an Arbitrum Orbit chain (L3) with Arbitrum Sepolia (L2) as the base chain. You can follow the same steps with any [other supported chains](/da/build-with-availOptimium/arbitrum-nitro/nitro-stack#reference) with the relevant contract addresses.

<Callout type="info">
This guide is based on [Arbitrum Orbit Quickstart](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart)
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

#### Docker
- You need to have [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine.
#### Avail 
- An Avail account with some AVAIL tokens in it. You can refer to [our docs here](/user-guides/accounts) to get started.
- An application key (`app-id`) for your rollup. Learn [how to get your `app-id` here](/da/build-with-availinteract-with-avail-da/app-id). 

#### Arbitrum Sepolia 
- At least 1 ETH over Arbsepolia Testnet. You can follow [Step 1](https://docs.arbitrum.io/launch-orbit-chain/orbit-quickstart#step-1-acquire-arbitrum-testnet-eth-and-the-native-token-for-orbit-chains-with-custom-gas-tokens) on Arbitrum Orbit Doc for acquiring testnet $ETH
- This guide will use [Arbitrum's ArbSepolia](https://docs.arbitrum.io/build-decentralized-apps/public-chains#arbitrum-sepolia) and [Avail's Turing](/da/networks) testnets.


## Download avail-nitro-node docker image

### Step-1: Download the [avail-nitro-node](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/availj/avail-nitro-node/tags) image from docker hub
    
    ```bash
    docker pull availj/avail-nitro-node:v2.2.1-upstream-v3.2.1
    ```
    

## Deploy Rollup Contracts

### Step-1: Clone the [arbitrum-orbit-sdk](https://github.com/availproject/arbitrum-orbit-sdk/tree/avail-develop-upstream-v0.20.1) with AvailDA 
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/availproject/arbitrum-orbit-sdk.git
    git checkout avail-develop-upstream-v0.20.1
    cd arbitrum-orbit-sdk
    ```

Install and build 

    ```bash
    npm i && npm run build
    ```
    
### Step-2: Create `.env` file

    Go to `examples/create-avail-rollup-eth` and create a copy of `.env.example` as `.env` file inside.
    

    ```bash
    cd examples/create-avail-rollup-eth
    cp env.example .env
    ```
    
    then edit the `.env` file for the following:

- Set EVM account keys of settlement layer
    
    ```bash
    DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY :- Orbit rollup owner, Rollup contract deployer
    BATCH_POSTER_PRIVATE_KEY -: Batch poster
    VALIDATOR_PRIVATE_KEY :- Validator
    ```
    
- Set avail account info for DA submissions
    
    ```bash
    AVAIL_ADDR_SEED=
    AVAIL_APP_ID=
    ```
    
- Set Fallback S3, if you want to enable S3 storage as a fallback for AvailDA (its an optional feature)
    - Fill these required details where make `FALLBACKS3_ENABLE = true`
    
    ```bash
    FALLBACKS3_ENABLE=true
    FALLBACKS3_ACCESS_KEY=
    FALLBACKS3_SECRET_KEY=
    FALLBACKS3_REGION=
    FALLBACKS3_OBJECT_PREFIX=
    FALLBACKS3_BUCKET=
    ```
    
- Set parent chain rpc URL (other than infura will also works)
    
    ```bash
    PARENT_CHAIN_RPC=https://arbitrum-sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    
### Step-3: Rollup contract deployment
  
  - Run avail orbit rollup deployment command
    
    ```bash
    npm run deploy-avail-orbit-rollup
    ```
    
- Here is a sample response of logs that you may see:
      <br/>
      <p align="center">
      <img src="/img/nitro-stack-1.png" alt="nitro-stack"/>
      </p>
    
- You will get to see two files added `nodeConfig.json` and `orbitSetupScriptConfig.json`, which will be need in the next step to spin and set up Avail Orbit Rollup.

#### Before proceeding, let's briefly review what just happened:

1. You submitted a deployment transaction to an Orbit "factory" smart contract on the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet, the public L2 chain that your local Orbit chain will settle transactions to.
2. This Orbit smart contract then initialized your Orbit chain's base contracts with the values that you specified in the previous step, and deployed these base contracts to the Arbitrum Sepolia testnet.

Your Orbit chain's base contracts are responsible for facilitating the exchange of information between your chain's node(s) and its base chain's nodes. This includes the batch posting of transactions from your Orbit chain to its base chain, the staking of tokens by your Orbit chain's validators the challenge mechanism, bridging mechanisms, and more.


## Spin up the avail orbit rollup chain using orbit-setup-script

### Step-1: Download [orbit-setup-script](https://github.com/availproject/orbit-setup-script.git)
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/availproject/orbit-setup-script.git
cd orbit-setup-script
    ```
    
### Step-2 :- Run your chain

Add the `nodeConfig.json` and `orbitSetupScriptConfig.json` in `./config` , that you get after completing Deploy Rollup contracts

```bash
cd orbit-setup-script
docker-compose up -d
```
A Nitro node and BlockScout explorer instance will be started. Visit [**http://localhost:4000/**](http://localhost:4000/) to access your BlockScout explorer instance - this will allow you to view your chain's transactions and blocks, which can be useful for debugging.

### Step-3: Final Setup - Token bridge deployment

A Hardhat script that handles the following tasks:

1. Fund the **batch-poster** and **validator** (staker) accounts on your underlying L2 chain.
2. Deposit ETH into your account on the chain using your chain's newly deployed bridge.
3. Deploy your Token Bridge contracts on both L2 and local Orbit chains.
4. Configure parameters on the chain.

To run this script, issue the following command from the root of the `orbit-setup-script` repository, replacing `OxYourPrivateKey` with the private key of the `Owner` account you used to deploy your chain's contracts, and replacing `http://localhost:8449` with the RPC URL of your chain's node.

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY="0xYourPrivateKey" L2_RPC_URL="https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc" L3_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8449" yarn run setup
```


## Hurray!

**Congratulations,** Your local Orbit chain with Avail DA is now running.

### Appendix A:- Use Arbitrum bridge for your local chain

After completing final setup, you can find two files `network.json` and `outputInfo.json`.
Add in your avail orbit rollup testnet to the [bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?destinationChain=arbitrum-sepolia&sourceChain=sepolia). This will only be for local testing.
Paste `outputInfo.json` configuration in setting section of bridge

#### Appendix B: Logging
Run this command in the root directory of your orbit setup script repo to view your chain's logs:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f nitro
```

#### Appendix C: Depositing ETH/native token
If you need to deposit more ETH (or native tokens) into your Orbit chain account, run this command on the base directory of the setup script, replacing `0xYourPrivateKey` with the private key of the originating account, and `<AMOUNT>` with the amount to send:

Using Arbitrum Sepolia:
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY="0xYourPrivateKey" L2_RPC_URL="https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc" L3_RPC_URL="http://localhost:8449"
AMOUNT="<AMOUNT>" yarn run deposit
```

#### Appendix D: Refunding (For testing environments)
Once you're done with your local Orbit chain and want to refund any remaining balance from the batch poster and validator wallets, you can use the refund script by running:

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY="0xYourPrivateKey" L2_RPC_URL="<https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc>" TARGET_ADDRESS="0xYourTargetAddress" yarn run refund
```

<Callout type="info">
Make sure to replace `"0xYourPrivateKey"` with the private key of the wallet you used to deploy the rollup contracts, and `"0xYourTargetAddress"` with the address where you want to receive the refunded funds.
</Callout>

This will transfer any remaining balance from the batch poster and validator wallets to the specified target address.

#### Appendix E: Troubleshooting
You may see error getting latest batch count in your node's output logs (from Appendix B). This is usually safe to ignore. It's usually displayed when your Orbit chain's base contract deployment isn't yet finalized on the L1 chain. This finalization can take 15-20 minutes, but don't worry - the deployment doesn't need to be L1-finalized in order for your chain to function properly.
