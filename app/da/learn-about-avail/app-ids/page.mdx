## Introduction

As a general-purpose base layer, Avail is designed to support many
modular chains at the same time, providing consensus and data
availability to all of them simultaneously.

How does this work? Avail headers contain an index that allows a given
modular chain (or "application" in Avail terminology) to determine and
download _only_ the sections of a block that have data for that
particular application.

This has significant benefits, including:

- Modular applications are mainly unaffected by other uses of the
  base layer at the same time.

- Block sizes can increase without requiring applications to fetch
  more data because they don't need to fetch the whole block, only what's
  relevant to them. \
  This filtering is done using the "application id" (AppId).

Data availability sampling is still done on the entire block,
however--this is the process where clients sample tiny parts of
the block at random to verify availability.

<Steps>

### Consider a random block on Avail DA

It might contain data blobs from a variety of different rollups pertaining to their different execution environments.
Think of the EVM, the SVM, Stackr, ZKsync chains, OP stack, and many more. \
If all of this data is randomnly strewn about in a block, it would be tedious for an a rollup to parse through all of it
just to fetch the data it needs.

</p>

### Now think of the same data neatly arranged into its own sections

But what if all of that same data in the same block was organised into different sections,
stored alongside it's peers. Each of these *'sections'* would be identified by an `AppID`. \
A developer now does not need to parse through the entire block to find the data they need, they can simply query data from the `AppID` they are interested in.

</p>

### These *'sections'* are flexible

All of the rollups running on Avail DA probably won't submit data in all of the blocks. Thus, it is likely some `AppIDs` will be empty in some blocks. \
On the flipside, some rollups might need to submit more data than usual in a particular block. \
None of this is an issue on Avail DA, the individual block builds as needed in the moment.

## Tell me more

Let's learn more about AppIds by going through a real-life example.

<Callout type="info">
1. We recommend you go through the whole page before trying to go through the same steps.

2. Although there are multiple ways to retrieve existing AppIds and generate new ones, using the [Avail DA explorer](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/chainstate) to do so
is a good way to start.

3. The [Avail DA explorer](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/) is very powerful and can be used in a variety of ways.
For now though, let's stick to `AppIds`.
</Callout>

1. Make sure you're on the `chain state` section of the explorer. You can access it by [simply clicking this link](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/chainstate),
or by navigating to it through the `developer` tab near the top right.

2. Make sure you've selected the `dataAvailability` pallet and the `appKeys` method.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-1.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

3. Uncheck the `include option` toggle, and click on the `+` button next to the method name.
You will fetch a list of all registered `AppIds` on Avail DA.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-2.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

Each `appID` consists of 3 fields:

- `key`: This is a string that is the name of the `appID`. Each `appID` should have a unique name.
- `owner`: This is the address of the account that created the `appID`. A single address can create multiple `AppIds`.
- `id`: This is the unique integer index of the `appID`. It is incremented by 1 everytime a new `appID` is created. Whenever a new
`appID` is created, it is automatically assigned the next available `id`.

4. Next, check the `include option` toggle, and enter `based avail` as the `bytes` input. Call the function. What do you see?
You will be returned a pair of `owner` and `id`, which together with the `key` you entered, form a unique `appID`.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-3.png"  align="center" /> 
</div>

<Callout type="info">
1. The `appKeys` method is essentially a mapping that returns the `owner` and `id` of an `appID` given its `key` (`key` => (`owner`, `id`)).
2. By checking the `include option` toggle, you are essentially filtering the output.
</Callout>

## How to check the next available `appID`?

Anyone can create their own `appID` on Avail DA. The process is entirely democratic, and it's rather simple too.

Let us first check out the next available `appID` on the network.

1. Within the `dataAvailability` pallet, select the `nextAppId` method.
No need to pass any params, just click the `+` button next to the method name.

2. You will be returned the next available `index`/`id` for a new `appID`.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-4.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

## How to register my own `appID`?

1. Make sure you have one or more Avail DA wallets connected to the explorer. If you don't know how to do so,
you can follow our docs on [setting up a new wallet](/user-guides/accounts#creating-an-account-on-avail-da).

2. Simply [click this link](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/extrinsics) OR navigate to the `extrinsics` section of the explorer through the `developer` tab.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that the `Developer` tab does not show the `extrinsics` section at all if you don't
have a wallet set up on the explorer or an extension wallet connected to it.
So make sure you have an [Avail DA wallet set up](/user-guides/accounts) before moving forward.
</Callout>

3. Select the `dataAvailability` pallet, and the `createApplicationKey` method.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-5.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

4. Enter a `key` for your `appID`. It can be anything you like, really.

5. This is how it should look like in the end:

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-6.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

6. Click on `Submit Transaction`, and then click on `Sign and Submit` in the box that pops up.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-7.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

<Callout type="info">
**DO NOT CHANGE THE `appID` FOR THIS TRANSACTION**<br/>

1. Each and every single transaction on Avail DA has an `appID` associated with it, which is **greater than or equal to** `0`.
2. A transaction or data submission with the `appID` of `0` is used for **chain-level** operations.
3. This is what we need to use for creating a new `appID`, since the act of creating a new `appID` has nothing to do with a specific '*app*' on Avail DA.
4. This field would instead have been a positive integer if we, for example, were submitting data to a specific application on Avail DA.
</Callout>

7. Authorize the transaction through your wallet, and you're done! You've successfully created your own `appID` on Avail DA.

8. You can verify `7` by using the steps covered earlier to query the `appKeys` method :)

## How to submit data to my `appID`?

You can submit data to your, or any other `appID` on Avail DA using the explorer by calling the
`submitData` extrinsic from within the `dataAvailability` pallet.

1. Make sure you have one or more Avail DA wallets connected to the explorer. If you don't know how to do so,
you can follow our docs on [setting up a new wallet](/user-guides/accounts#creating-an-account-on-avail-da).

2. Simply [click this link](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/extrinsics) OR navigate to the `extrinsics` section of the explorer through the `developer` tab.

3. Select the `dataAvailability` pallet, and the `submitData` method.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-8.png" align="center" />
</div>

4. Enter a random `data` string that you want to submit to your `appID`, and then click on
`Submit Transaction`.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-9.png" align="center" />
</div>

5. Fill in the `AppID` that you want to submit the data to. Click on `Sign and Submit` to authorize the transaction through your wallet.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-10.png" align="center" />
</div>

6. Wait for the transaction to be included in a block and then open the detailed view of the block.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-11.png" align="center" />
</div>

7. Click on your specific transaction to see it's details. This is what it should look like:

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-12.png" align="center" />
</div>


## A few more things of note

1. As stated earlier, the `key` and `id` fields of every `appID` are unique. This means if you try to create an `appID` with the same `key` as an existing one,
the operation will fail. This is why it makes sense to use the `appKeys` method to check if your desired name is already taken.

2. If you're a developer and are looking for more programmatic instructions, you can check out our [API reference](/da/api-reference/avail-node-api/da-create-application-key).

3. **Anyone can submit any sort of data to any `appID` regardless of whether or not they created it.** \
*But what does this mean? And is this an attack vector?*

- This is where it is important to understand that Avail DA is a DA layer, not an execution environment.
We are not concerned with the validity of the data being submitted, only with its availability, which means we can support a wide variety of applications across multiple tech stacks.
- This does not constitute an attack vector since that any app or execution layer building on top of Avail DA can always set up
certain rules to filter out unwanted data submissions.
- They could for example make it so that only data submitted with a particular signature, i.e. from a particular address, is accepted.
All other data submitted to the particular `appID` is treated as spam, and ignored.
