# Get started with the Avail Apps Explorer


<Callout type="info">
The Avail network has two main explorers that can be used to browse the network:

1. [Avail Apps explorer](https://explorer.avail.so/): A dev-focussed explorer with powerful tools to work with the network.
2. [Subscan explorer](https://avail-turing.subscan.io/): A simpler, and recommended way to explore the network for most users.

This tutorial will focus on helping advanced users and devs get started with the Avail Apps Explorer.
</Callout>

## Look up the details of a particular transaction [#lookup-transactions]

<Callout type="info">
1. Due to how the network is designed, it is not possible for the `AvailApps` explorer to query a transaction's details using just it's hash directly from a node.

2. The `Subscan` explorer however, makes it possible to do so, since it queries from a dedicated indexer
built on top of Avail to support this feature.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={['AvailApps Explorer', 'Subscan Explorer']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

<Callout type="info">
**Search for a txn using it's `block number`/`block hash` *AND* it's `transaction hash`**<br/>
ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
</Callout>

1. Search for the `block number` or `block hash` of the block your transaction was included in.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-3.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

2. The explorer then fetches all transactions from that specific block. Click on the hash of the transaction you are interested in to get a detailed view.

## Create accounts within the explorer [#the-accounts-section]


<Tabs items={['AvailApps Explorer']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
The `AvailApps` explorer can be used to add or import Avail accounts into the explorer.

To go to the page, click on the `Accounts` tab on the top-left, or click [this link](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/accounts).
1. The `accounts` section shows any accounts created straight from the explorer. You don't need any wallet extensions to create or use them.
2. The `extension` section shows any accounts connected to the explorer from wallets like `Polkadot.js`, `Subwallet`, `Talisman`, etc...

The following gif shows you how to create an account straight from the explorer:

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/account-creation.gif" align="center" />
</div>

You can do a few things here:

1. Create a new account using a `mnemonic` or by clicking on the `+ Account` button.
2. Import an account via an encrypted JSON file.
3. Connect extension accounts from wallets like `Polkadot.js`, `Subwallet`, `Talisman`, etc...
4. Create a multisig account. We have covered instructions to do so [in our docs here](/user-guides/avail-multisig).
5. Create a proxy account. We have covered instructions to do so [in our docs here](/user-guides/avail-proxy).
6. The `AvailApps` explorer also allows you to use hardware wallets to safely connect cold accounts. We have covered
instructions to do so [in our docs here](/user-guides/ledger-avail).

> Any of these accounts that you connect can be used to sign transactions on the network. Which is something we will cover in the next section.

## Using the explorers to interact with the network

<Tabs items={['AvailApps Explorer', 'Subscan Explorer']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
Wrt interacting with the network, the `AvailApps` explorer can be used to:

1. Query data from the network by calling `Chain State` or `RPC` methods.
2. Send transactions to the network by signing and submitting `Extrinsics`.

You can find them within the `Developer` tab.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-6.png" align="center" />
</div>


<Callout type="info">
**WHAT ARE PALLETS?**<br/>
Avail organizes its runtime functionality into `pallets`. Each pallet is a collection of calls and extrinsics of a specific functionality. 
For example, the `data_availability` pallet contains all the calls and extrinsics related to querying and submitting data to the network, and so on.
Some methods might be grouped into seemingly unrelated pallets for technical reasons, but this largely holds true.

To look for a particular method within the `AvailApps` explorer, you need to know the pallet it belongs to.
</Callout>

### How to use the explorer to query the network

Let us learn how to query the network using the `AvailApps` explorer by querying the balance of an account.
1. Either go to the `Chain State` methods menu from within the `Developer` tab or click [on this link](https://explorer.avail.so/#/chainstate).

2. The balance of an account can be queried by calling the `account(AccountId32)` method from within the `system` pallet. Select the `system`
pallet from the dropdown on the left, and the `account(AccountId32)` method from the dropdown on the right.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-7.png" align="center" />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
**THE `include option` TOGGLE**<br/>
This toggle allows you to enter params for a method when it is toggled on.
You can also call methods without passing a param by keeping it off. \
But `system_account` method won't return anything without an `AccountId32` param being passed to it, so we will keep it on. \
**Hot tip:** Try calling the `dataAvailability_appKeys` method with the `include option` toggle off to see what happens.
</Callout>

3. Either paste the address of an account in the `AccountId32` field or select an explorer-connected account from the dropdown.

4. Leave the `blockhash` field empty (This will query the latest balance of the account), and click on the `+` button near the top-right.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-8.png" align="center" />
</div>

5. And that's it. You just used the `AvailApps` explorer to query the balance of an account on the Avail network. You can query other methods in a similar way.


### How to use the explorer to send transactions to the network

You can also use the `AvailApps` explorer to sign custom transactions/extrinsics and submit them to the network.
We have covered different examples of doing so in our docs. Here is one of them:

[Submit data to a particular `AppID` by submitting a `dataAvailability_submitData` extrinsic](/docs/learn-about-avail/app-ids#how-to-submit-data-to-my-appid).

### Bonus: How to query chain constants using the explorer

1. The `AvailApps` explorer allows you to query the current values of all of it's runtime constants by going to the constants tab within
`Developer -> Chain State`.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-9.png" align="center" />
</div>

2. For example, to query the current value of the `existentialDeposit` of an account on Avail, which is the minimum amount required by an
account to exist on the network, you can call the `balances_existentialDeposit` constant.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-10.png" align="center" />
</div>

> P.S: The balance displayed is in `attoAVAIL`. 1 `attoAVAIL` = $10^{-18}$ `AVAIL`.

3. You can look up any other constant in a similar way.

The `Subscan` explorer leverages it's dedicated indexer to enable users to browse the network in some neat ways.

1. You can browse network activity more conveniently by using different filters.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/subscan-explorer-5.png" align="center" />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
- `Blocks`: Browse blocks by number.
- `Extrinsics`: Browse all extrinsics submitted to the network.
- `Transfers`: Browse all extrinsics that involve `AVAIL` token transfers.
- `Data Submission`: Browse all data submissions to the network.
</Callout>

2. The `Staking` section allows you to browse the staking activity on the network.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/subscan-explorer-6.png" align="center" />
</div>

3. The `Governance` section allows you to browse all governance-related activity on the network, including all past proposals.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/subscan-explorer-7.png" align="center" />
</div>

4. The `Tools` section supports some useful features:

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/subscan-explorer-8.png" align="center" />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
- `Charts`: Some charts for a visual representation of network activity.
- `Account Format Transform`: Transform an account address into different formats supported by various Substrate-based chains.
- `Price Converter`: Lookup the historical price of `AVAIL` by `block number` or `timestamp`.
- `Runtime`: Browse data related to runtime extrinsics.
</Callout>
