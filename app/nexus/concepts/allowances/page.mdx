# Allowances

The Nexus SDK requires allowances.

Through allowances, a user permits the use of EOA funds in the source chains.
The protocol uses these funds to pay the gas fee and the transaction amount
on the destination chain.

 - The default allowance limit set in the Nexus SDK for each supported chain is `unlimited`.
- Developers can change the allowance for each chain abstracted transaction.
- They can do this using the `setOnAllowanceHook` hook.

An intent details list the amounts collected per source chain to transact on the
destination chain. Users can choose to accept or reject a Nexus transaction.
They cannot change allowances specified by the developers.

Until a user **permits** allowance, the Avail Vault contracts on the source chains cannot collect the user funds for Nexus operations.

By approving allowances for chain abstraction on the source chains, users can:

* Spend anywhere with funds from two or more source chains.
* Bypass bridging to enable liquidity on the destination chain.
* Transact on newer chains with zero or insufficient liquidity.

## How Allowances Work?

Here is how the allowances enables chain abstracted transactions:

1. User approves the protocol to access funds from two or more source chains.
2. Protocol unifies user balance across these chains.
3. Unified funds go into protocol vaults.
4. The protocol presents the user with an intent to transact on the destination along with amount and fee details.
5. The user signs the intent. Solvers then supply liquidity in the user's EOA to transact on the destination chain.
6. User can now transact on any destination chain and pay gas fee.
7. The protocol settles transactions with the solvers using the funds collected on the source chains.
