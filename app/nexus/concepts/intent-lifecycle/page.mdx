# Intent Lifecycle

The intent processing begins when the user signs an intent and authorizes a transaction. 

A [solver](/nexus/concepts/solvers) (a liquidity provider) steps in to supply the necessary funds (`Fill`) on the destination chain. The protocol is responsible for settling the source chain funds with the respective solver. 

The intent details shows which solver provided liquidity once the intent is successfully processed.
