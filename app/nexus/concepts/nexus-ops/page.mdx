# What is Bridge, Transfer, Bridge & Execute?

In Nexus, apart from [crosschain swaps](/nexus/concepts/xcs-swaps), users can do ***Bridge, Transfer, Bridge & Execute*** which uses Nexus chain abstraction (aka **Bridge Methods**).

Let's understand what each Nexus operation is and what it does. 

## Bridge

During the `Bridge` operation, the funds are bridged from N source chains to the user's preferred destination chain. 

    `Sender` = `Recipient`

This function uses the `BridgeParams` struct and the `bridge` function from the Bridge Methods in the SDK.


## Transfer 
During the `Transfer` operation, the funds are bridged from N source chains from the `Sender` to the user's preferred destination chain at a different `Receiver` address. It is a compound operation i.e. it involves the bridging of funds from different sources to a destination chain and then funds are transferred to the `Recipient` address. 

    `Sender` != `Recipient`

This function uses the `TransferParams` struct and the `bridgeAndTransfer` function from the Bridge Methods in the SDK.


## Bridge & Execute

The `Bridge & Execute` operation is a more complex compound operation in Nexus. In this operation, the user bridges liquidity from N sources chains if there is a lack of enough liquidity on the destination chain, and then executes any arbitrary smart contract function. 

Note that the smart contract can be any onchain contract on the destination chain. ALl the developer needs is the contract `address`, function `name` & `params`, and `ABI`. 

For users, this means they don't have to do a separate bridge action to use a `Liquid App` (Nexus powered application), and just use the app as they would if they had liquidity onchain. 

A bridgeless experience.
