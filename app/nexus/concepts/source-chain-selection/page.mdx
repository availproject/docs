# Selecting source chains for Nexus operations

When a user does a [Nexus operation](/nexus/concepts/nexus-ops), it involves the sourcing of liquidity by Nexus from wherever they have it. 

Selection of the source chain essentially indicates what route(s) is being chosen for liquidity to flow through to be received and utilized on the destination chain.

### Bridge Methods
For [Bridge Methods](/nexus/avail-nexus-sdk/bridge-methods), this means you can just specify the chain IDs of the chains you want to limit sourcing liquidity from. 

```jsx
sourceChains?: number[];
```

If kept in its default setting, the Nexus protocol handles the source selection using an internal algorithm. But if needed, the developer can enable/disable the selection of source chains and limit liquidity be sourced form the set chains **ONLY**. 

### Swap Methods
For [Swap Methods](/nexus/concepts/bridge-v-swap), you can define the source chains when using the `ExactIn` Swap method. In this case you also need to mention the `chainId`, `amount`, and `tokenAddress`.

```jsx
interface ExactInSwapInput {
  from: {
    chainId: number;
    amount: bigint;
    tokenAddress: Hex;
  }[];
...
```
