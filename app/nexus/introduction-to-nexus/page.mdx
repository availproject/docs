# Introduction to Nexus

Nexus is a meta-interoperability protocol that eliminates blockchain fragmentation by connecting liquidity, assets, and coordination logic at the base layer. It abstracts complexities such as manual bridging, chain switching, wallet switching, swaps, and complex approvals for the end user to create a seamless “bridgeless” experience. 

## How does Nexus fit into The Avail Stack

The Avail Stack delivers modular data availability (DA), seamless interoperability (Nexus), and ZK-verified execution, so you can build faster, cheaper, and without compromises. The Avail Stack makes it easy to bring new apps to market faster, with numerous upgrades for those held back by legacy blockchain technology. 

Nexus directly solves a fundamental challenge for emerging rollups and appchains: the lack of *relevant* infrastructure and native liquidity. When a new chain launches, it often doesn’t have AMMs, money markets, or oracles live on day one. But with Nexus, that’s no longer a blocker.

Sophon (a chain on Avail) may not have Uniswap, but Lens (another Avail-powered chain) does. With Nexus, a Sophon app user can use Uniswap on Lens *without* leaving Sophon, bridging assets, or switching wallets.

All the complex stuff—bridging, swapping, messaging—happens behind the scenes with Nexus.

The user just approves a transaction in their wallet, and everything works as if it happened directly on the Sophon app. What used to take 12+ steps now takes just 3-4 simple clicks.

Nexus is a core component of the Avail stack that connects different rollups, enabling easy sharing of liquidity and infrastructure, and creating a seamless user experience across Web3.

## Is Avail Nexus a bridge? How does it compare to regular web3 bridges?

***Avail Nexus is not a bridge. It is an interoperability toolkit for developers to access crosschain liquidity from anywhere to their app easily.***

The status quo in web3 is currently fragmented. It forces users to risk bridging their assets into application silos, and developers have to navigate confusing multi-chain deployments instead of building better apps. The experience is cumbersome and frustrating for everyone.

Today, as chains proliferate, bridges today don't cut it for a seamless user and developer experience. Liquidity is distributed unevenly across ecosystems, and not all apps are able to tap into this liquidity as easily.

Today chains work with bridges to bring liquidity to their chain ecosystem so that it incentivizes apps to build on them, while it creates a flywheel effect of more users wanting to bridge to the chain. Typically, bridging to chains can range from under a minute to over 10-15 mins, depending on the source and destination chain used for the process.

Here's how a chain usually onboards liquidity:

Avail Nexus simplifies building cross-chain apps for developers. App developers today chase maintaining multiple instances of their app across different networks or rely on trust-heavy bridging solutions with partial interoperability. 

Nexus aims to reframe the mindset of both consumers and developers when using or building apps. 

For users, Nexus abstracts away all cross-chain complexities such as manual bridging, chain switching, etc. Users can seamlessly interact with other apps and assets from different networks without ever leaving their current application. 

Developers benefit from the '*deploy once, scale everywhere*' paradigm that Nexus enables across a modular blockchain ecosystem, eliminating the need to integrate and maintain multiple versions of the same app on different networks. They can tap into liquidity by building on any chain.
