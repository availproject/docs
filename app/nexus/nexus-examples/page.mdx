# Build your First Liquid App from scratch

If you want a more detailed, barebones guide on how to get started. This is the right place!

Get started with building your first Liquid App. 

Start off with a basic NextJS app and in each step add components along the way that uses Nexus to give your app much more utility. 

You'll eventually build a Liquid App that can deposit assets from any chain into AAVE on your preferred destination chain (Arbitrum Sepolia in this guide).
