# Use Avail DA with MetaMask

## Introduction

MetaMask is one of the most popular wallets for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains out there.
MetaMask Snaps is an open source system that allows developers to create a custom '*Snap*'
that can be installed into a user's MetaMask wallet to extend it's functionality for different chains.

You can check out [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/snaps) and [MetaMask docs](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/) for more information.

The Avail snap will allow you to easily interact with Avail DA from within your MetaMask wallet.
We are actively working on adding more features to the Avail Snap, so stay tuned for updates.

### Use the Avail Snap

<Callout type="info">
  The Avail Snap generates an address for you based on the seed phrase embedded into your
  MetaMask wallet. Thus, if you transfer the same wallet to a new system and install
  the Avail Snap again, you will derive the same address.
</Callout>

Go to [snap.availproject.org](https://snap.availproject.org/), which is a UI interface that
allows you to conveniently use the Avail Snap.

Connect your metamask extension to this webpage by clicking on '_Connect with MetaMask_'.
Once connected, you will see your derived address and its balance on screen:

</div>

<Callout type="info">
**PLEASE NOTE**<br/>
1. You will need to send some AVAIL tokens to your new address before being able to make a transaction with it.
2. You can toggle between Avail DA testnet and mainnet by using the dropdown on the top right. Make sure to select the correct network.

## FAQs

### Why should I use the Avail Snap at all?

MetaMask is an EVM-compatible wallet that supports 20-byte hexadecimal addresses derived from seed phrases and/or private keys.
Avail DA meanwhile uses the [SS58 address format](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/accounts-addresses-keys/#address-encoding-and-chain-specific-addresses).
The Avail Snap makes it possible for you to conveniently interact with Avail DA from within your MetaMask wallet.

### How does the Avail Snap work?

[MetaMask Snaps](https://metamask.io/snaps/) is an open source solution designed to extend MetaMask's functionality.
The Avail Snap derives an SS58 address using your MetaMask credentials and allows you to sign transactions
on Avail DA through an easy-to-use UI interface.

### What if I switch to a new system?

The Avail Snap generates an address for you based on the secret recovery phrase in your MetaMask wallet.
Thus, if you transfer the same wallet to a new system and install the Avail Snap again, you will derive the same
address.
