# How to Set an On-Chain Identity

## Introduction

Avail allows you to set canonical on-chain identities for your accounts via the `identity_setIdentity` extrinsic. \
The AvailApps explorer provides a convenient UI to set an identity for your account, which is what we will be doing in the
next section.

<br/>
<details className="border p-3 rounded-md bg-[#EFF6FF]">
<summary>Identities vs Sub-Identities</summary>

1. Each account on Avail can create a main identity and up to 100 sub-identities.
2. Each of these sub-identities are linked to the main account.
3. A possible way of using this feature could be to create a main identity for your team, and then create sub-identities
for each of your team members.
4. A deposit of `2 AVAIL` is required per sub-identity.
</details>

<Callout type="info">
1. Users need to lock a small account of `AVAIL` to set an identity, which is refunded if and when the identity is cleared.
2. The bond amount for registering an on-chain identity is currently **100 AVAIL**.
3. The bond amount for registering each sub-identity is **2 AVAIL**.
4. The maximum number of sub-identities per identity is **100**.
