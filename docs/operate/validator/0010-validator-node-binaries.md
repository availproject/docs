## Preliminaries

Validator nodes hold a pivotal role in maintaining network integrity by staking real-value tokens. Successfully managing a validator comes with a comprehensive grasp of node operations, hardware configuration, and constant vigilance. Validators face the potential consequences of penalties, such as slashing, for infractions like extended periods of offline activity or equivocation. This responsibility underscores the need for a profound understanding of the associated risks.

:::warning System administration

While Avail is currently in its testnet phase, running validator nodes requires significant system administration expertise.

:::

Becoming a validator is a significant responsibility because mistakes or errors can jeopardize not just your tokens but also your reputation, given your role in managing both your stake and that of your nominators. Despite these challenges, it offers a rewarding chance to enhance network security and be incentivized.

## Run a Validator Node

First, follow the steps for running a full node as outlined in the
[Full Node Setup Instructions](/category/run-a-validator-node/).

To run a validator node, you'll use the same command as the full node with the addition of the `--validator` option.

For example:

```bash
./data-avail --validator \
    --port 30333 \
    --base-path `pwd`/data \
    --chain kate
```

The node will ouput the following when started:

**Please take note that the role now displays as `Authority`, indicating that your node is operating as a validator node.**

> If you were previously running a full node and added the `--validator` flag after syncing, you may encounter an error expecting an archive database. In such cases, it's necessary to purge the existing database and then restart the node.

For the best practice, it is highly recommended to run your node as a service.

```
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/availd.service > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Avail Validator
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0

[Service]
User=avail
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=120
ExecStart=/home/avail/avail-node/data-avail --base-path /home/avail/avail-node/data --chain /home/avail/avail-node/chainspec.raw.json --port 30333 --validator --name MyAvailNode

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Enable auto restart on for your Avail node:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable availd.service
```

Start your avail node:

```bash
sudo systemctl start availd.service
```

Check the node is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status availd.service
```

View the logs from the running service:

```bash
journalctl -f -u availd.service
```
