# Avail bridge API reference

<Callout type="info">
**BEFORE WE START**<br/>
1. The Avail VectorX bridge can be used to pass messages and tokens between \
Avail DA Turing - Ethereum Sepolia (testnet bridge),
and between Avail DA mainnet - Ethereum mainnet (mainnet bridge).
2. You can check out a complete list of endpoints required to use the bridge API in the [networks page](/docs/networks#for-devs).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**TWO WAYS OF USING THE BRIDGE API**<br/>
1. You can build and run the bridge API locally using the instructions outlined in this repo:
[availproject/bridge-api](https://github.com/availproject/bridge-api)
2. We have included two public endpoints for the bridge API in the [networks page](/docs/networks#for-devs) that you can use.
For the sake of simplicity that is what we will be using in this guide.

## Setting up the dev environment


<Tabs items={['CURL', 'avail-deno', 'avail-rust']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. To use the Avail bridge API with `curl`, you just need to have `curl` installed on your system. 
You can check if it is installed by running:

```sh
curl --version
```

2. If this does not work, go to [curl's website](https://curl.se/) to install it on your system.

1. Make sure `deno-js` is installed on your system. You can refer to [Deno's docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/) for the same.

2. Create a new Deno JS project by running `deno init` in a directory of your choice.

1. Make sure `rust` and cargo are installed on your system. You can refer to [Rustlang's docs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for the same.

2. Create a new Rust project by running `cargo init`.

3. Paste the following into your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
