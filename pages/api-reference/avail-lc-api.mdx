# Avail Light Client reference

<Callout type="info">
BEFORE WE START
1. The indiviual behaviour of some methods may differ depending on which mode the light client is runnning in.
This will be documented in the individual method descriptions.
2. It is recommended to use `API-v2` over `API-v1`, although both are supported.
3. The methods documented here were tested on a locally running instance of the Avail light client.
They will however work with remotely hosted instances as well.
4. You can check out or docs for [instructions on running your own instance
of the Avail light client](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-light-client/0010-light-client)
</Callout>

## Setting up the dev environment

Set up your dev enviornment with `curl` and `Rust`:

<Tabs items={['CURL', 'Rust']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. To use the Avail light client API with `curl`, you just need to have `curl` installed on your system. 
You can check if it is installed by running:

```sh
curl --version
```

2. If this does not work, go to [curl's website](https://curl.se/) to install it on your system.

How to run the Rust code snippets:

1. Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Cargo](https://crates.io/) installed on your system before moving forward. You can check that by running:
    ```sh
    rustc --version && cargo --version
    ```
    If either of these don't work, you can check out [Rust's official installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
     

1. Create a new Rust project:
    ```sh
    cargo new <project-name>
    ```
2. Add these dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file:
    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    reqwest = { version = "0.12", features = ["json"] }
    serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
    serde_json = "1.0"
    tokio = { version = "1.36", features = ["full"] }
    base64 = "0.22"
    ```
3. Paste the code snippets into the `main.rs` file, and run the project with `cargo run`.
