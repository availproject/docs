# WebSocket API

The Avail light client WebSocket API allows real-time communication between a client and a server over a 
persistent connection. The Web socket API can be used on its own or in combination with HTTP API to enable different pull/push use cases.

<summary> HTTPS vs WSS</summary>
`HTTP` and `Websocket` are two different ways of communicating with a server. `HTTP` is a request-response protocol,
where a connection persists for only so long as the request is being processed. In contrast, a websocket connection
persists for as long as the client and server are connected. This allows for real-time communication between the two,
and enables the client to fetch information from the server as soon as it is available, without having to
poll the server for updates.

HOW TO CONNECT TO THE WEBSOCKET SERVER <br/>
You cannot use `CURL` to send websocket commands, since `CURL` cannot maintain a persistent connection.
Although there are a variety of librariries we can use, the following examples are using [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat).

To install `wscat`, simply run:
```sh
npm install -g wscat
```

## Get started with the Websocket Avail LC API

1. The Avail LC Websocket API generates a unique `subscription_id` upon request. 
2. This ID is used to connect to the websocket server.
3. The `v2/subscriptions` method creates subscriptions for given topics. In case of reconnects, the user needs to subscribe again.

### Generate a subscription ID

1. The very first step in using the Avail LC Websocket API is to generate a subscription ID.
2. You can do that using a simple `Curl` request to the `v2/subscriptions` endpoint.


Request:

<Tabs items={['CURL', 'Rust']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs items={['Local', 'Remote']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
```sh
curl -X POST "http://localhost:7007/v2/subscriptions" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "topics": ["header-verified", "confidence-achieved", "data-verified"],
           "data_fields": ["data", "extrinsic"]
         }'
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
```sh
curl -X POST "https://api.lightclient.mainnet.avail.so/v2/subscriptions" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "topics": ["header-verified", "confidence-achieved", "data-verified"],
           "data_fields": ["data", "extrinsic"]
         }'
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

</Tabs.Tab>


<Tabs.Tab>
```rust
use reqwest::{Client, StatusCode};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use serde_json::json;

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct SubscriptionResponse {
    subscription_id: String,
}

const LIGHT_CLIENT_URL: &str = "https://api.lightclient.mainnet.avail.so";

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let client = Client::new();
    let subscriptions_url = format!("{LIGHT_CLIENT_URL}/v2/subscriptions");
    let topics = vec!["header-verified", "confidence-achieved", "data-verified"];
    let data_fields = vec!["data", "extrinsic"];

    let response = client.post(&subscriptions_url)
        .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
        .body(json!({ "topics": topics, "data_fields": data_fields }).to_string())
        .send()
        .await
        .unwrap();

    match response.status() {
        StatusCode::OK => {
            let subscription_response: SubscriptionResponse = response.json().await.unwrap();
            println!("Subscription ID: {}", subscription_response.subscription_id);
        }
        _ => {
            eprintln!("Failed to create subscription: {}", response.status());
        }
    }
    // ...error handling...
}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>


<details className="border p-3 rounded-md bg-[#EFF6FF] border-[#] hover:!bg-[#EFF6FF]">
<summary> Sample Response:</summary>

```yaml
{
  "subscription_id": "{subscription-id}"
}
```
</details>

### Initialize the Websocket connection

You can use this method to actually connect to Avail light client web socket. Multiple connections are currently allowed.

To connect to the Avail LC websocket API, you need:

1. Access to a [running Light Client](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-light-client/0010-light-client#running-the-light-client).
2. A subscription ID generated using the [`v2/subscriptions`](#v2subscriptions) method.
3. to run this wscat command in the terminal:

<Tabs items={['Local', 'Remote']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```sh
wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:7007/v2/ws/{subscription-id}
```
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
```sh
wscat -c wss://api.lightclient.mainnet.avail.so/v2/ws/{subscription-id}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Your terminal should look something like this:
<br/>
<img src="/img/websocket-connection.png" alt="Avail-fusion" width="100%"/>

<Callout type="info">
Please note that you will regularly receive information related to the topics you chose to subscribe to
for as long as the `ws` connection persists, even if you don't actually send any messages.
</Callout>

Every request should contain unique **request_id** field, used to correlate request with response.

## Subscription IDs vs Request IDs

Each time you use the [`v2/subscriptions`](#v2subscriptions) method, you will receive a unique **subscription_id**. 
This ID is used to connect to the websocket server. 

Each of these IDs will be of the [UUID4 format](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4).

Coming to requests, every request you make to the websocket server should contain a **request_id** field,
which will need to be a UUID4 value. You can choose to use a single, random UUID4 value to send all your requests,
or you can use a unique UUID4 value for each request you send. The choice is yours.

Using a single UUID4 value is simple, but using a unique UUID4 value for each request can help you 
correlate each response with a unique request.

The Avail LC API was designed with dev experience in mind, and this way you can choose the way that suits you best.
