# v2/ws/&#123;subscription-id&#125;

You can use this method to actually connect to Avail Light Client web socket. Multiple connections are currently allowed.

To connect to the Avail LC websocket API, you need:

1. Access to a [running Light Client](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-light-client/0010-light-client#running-the-light-client).
2. A subscription ID generated using the [`v2/subscriptions`](#v2subscriptions) method.
3. to run this wscat command in the terminal:

<Tabs items={['wscat']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```sh
wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:7000/v2/ws/{subscription-id}
```
</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Your terminal should look something like this:

<Callout type="info">
Please note that you will regularly receive information related to the topics you chose to subscribe to
for as long as the `ws` connection persists, even if you don't actually send any messages.
</Callout>

Every request should contain unique **request_id** field, used to correlate request with response.

<summary> **Subscription IDs vs Request IDs** </summary>

Each time you use the [`v2/subscriptions`](#v2subscriptions) method, you will receive a unique **subscription_id**. 
This ID is used to connect to the websocket server. 

Each of these IDs will be of the [UUID4 format](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4).

Coming to requests, every request you make to the websocket server should contain a **request_id** field,
which will need to be a UUID4 value. You can choose to use a single, random UUID4 value to send all your requests,
or you can use a unique UUID4 value for each request you send. The choice is yours.

Using a sngle UUID4 value is simple, but using a unique UUID4 value for each request can help you 
correlate each response with a unique request.

The Avail LC API was designed with dev experience in mind, and this way you can choose the way that suits you best.
