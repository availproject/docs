# Avail Nexus API reference

## Setting up the dev environment

Set up your dev environment with `curl`:

<Tabs items={['CURL']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. To use the Avail light client API with `curl`, you just need to have `curl` installed on your system. 
You can check if it is installed by running:

```sh
curl --version
```

2. If this does not work, go to [curl's website](https://curl.se/) to install it on your system. 
</Tabs.Tab>
