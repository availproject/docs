# Avail node API reference

<Callout type="info">
BEFORE WE START
1. The Avail node supports an extensive list of extrinsics and various other types of calls that you can
[try out in our explorer](https://explorer.avail.so/#/extrinsics).
2. This API reference currently documents only the most widely used extrinsics, but will be iterated upon
to eventually be an exhaustive resource for the Avail node API.
</Callout>

## Setting up the dev environment

We have included examples of signing this extrinsic using the `avail-deno` and `avail-rust` SDKs.

1.  Make sure `Node-js` is installed on your system. You can refer to [Node-js docs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) for the same.

2. Create a new Node-js project by running `npm init -y` in a directory of your choice, and create a new file named `da_submitData.ts`

3. To install the `avail-js-sdk` run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install avail-js-sdk
```

4. Make sure to install the `ts-node` package if you haven't already:

```bash
npm i -g ts-node
```

5. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project and populate it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "build",
    "declaration": true,
