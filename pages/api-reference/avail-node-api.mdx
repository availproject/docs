# Avail node API reference

<Callout type="info">
BEFORE WE START
1. The Avail node supports an extensive list of extrinsics and various other types of calls that you can
[try out in our explorer](https://explorer.avail.so/#/extrinsics).
2. This API reference currently documents only the most widely used extrinsics, but will be iterated upon
to eventually be an exhaustive resource for the Avail node API.

2. Create a new Node-js project by running `npm init -y` in a directory of your choice, and create a new file named `your-file-name.ts`

3. To install the `avail-js-sdk` run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install avail-js-sdk@0.3.0
```

4. Make sure to install the `ts-node` package if you haven't already:

```bash
npm i -g ts-node
```

5. Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the root of your project and populate it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2016",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "build",
    "declaration": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "build"]

1. Make sure `avail-deno` is installed on your system. You can refer to [Deno's docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/) for the same.

2. Create a new Deno JS project by running `deno init` in a directory of your choice, and create a new file named `your-file-name.ts`
in the project.

3. The examples in this reference will interact with the Turing testnet of Avail DA, and will use the correspponding endpoint.
You can use the [networks page](/docs/networks) to find endpoints for mainnet if you need to.

3. Paste the following into your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[workspace]

[package]
name = "your-project-name"
edition = "2021"

```

3. To install the avail-go-sdk, use the following command to add it to your project:

``` bash
go get github.com/availproject/avail-go-sdk@latest
```

4. Create a `config.json` file in the root of your project and fill it up like this:

```json

	"api_url": "wss://turing-rpc.avail.so/ws",
	"size": 1000,
