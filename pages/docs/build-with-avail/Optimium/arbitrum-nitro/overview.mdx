# Building on the Arbitrum Nitro stack with Avail

## What is nitro

Nitro is designed by Arbitrum, a software stack to build optimistic rollup, powering two major market cap chains - arbitrum one and arbitrum nova.
These chains are Optimistic L2 protocols that inherit Ethereum-level security.

You can read more about Nitro in:
1. [The Nitro whitepaper on github](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/blob/master/docs/Nitro-whitepaper.pdf)
2. [Arbitrum docs.](https://docs.arbitrum.io/how-arbitrum-works/inside-arbitrum-nitro)

## What is Arbitrum Orbit integration with Avail DA

Chains created using Arbitrum Nitro Stack can be an L2 settling over ethereum or an L3 settling to any ethereum l2. 
The current nitro stack allows developers to deploy an orbit chain with Arbitrum One or Arbitrum Anytrust as DA layer.
With the new Avail DA integration in nitro stack, a developer gets one more data availability provider option which
can be enabled from node configuration.

Transaction Lifecycle

1. **Transaction Submission**
    - **Process**: Users send transactions to the Sequencer.
    - **Role**: The Sequencer temporarily holds the transactions before they are batched.
2. **Batch Processing**
    - **Component**: `Sequencer`
    - **Function**: Collects and order transactions into batches for more efficient processing.

3. **Batch Submission on Avail**
    - **component**: `arbnode/batch-poster`
    - **Process**: Sequencer post a batch of L2 transaction onto the underlying data availability provider

4. **BlobPointer Reference Creation**
    - **Outcome**: Avail returns a unique transaction reference with Merkle proof of 
    batch submission.

5. **BlobPointer Submission to Settlement layer ( Arbitrum one, ethereum etc.)**
    - **Process**: BlobPointer with Avail header byte(0x0a) is being sent over 
    to `sequencerInbox` rollup contract for on-chain da verification over Avail 
    bridge and batch addition to canonical chain.
    - **component:** [`SequncerInbox.sol`](https://github.com/availproject/nitro-contracts/blob/data-availability-verification-v2.3.1/src/bridge/SequencerInbox.sol#L587)

6. **on-chain Data availability verification** 
    - **Component**: [`Avail bridge`](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x445651a824b8BcAEAcE5FA1D6656e21F3bdac4E2#code)
    - **Function**: Verify `Merkle proof` for the batch submission with `dataRootCommitment` from [`VectorX`](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0xbc281367e1f2db1c3e92255aa2f040b1c642ec75#events).

7. Replay batch execution over WASM binary STF
    - **Component**: `Arbitrator, ArbState`
    - Process: Recover payload from Avail DA ([`RecoverPayloadFromAvailBatch`](https://github.com/availproject/avail-nitro-adapter/blob/data-availability-verification-v2.3.1/arbstate/inbox.go#L169C6-L169C34)), 
    and re-executes the State Transition Function against input messages to determine 
    the correct output block.
