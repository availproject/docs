# Deploy a ZK Stack Validium with Avail DA

## Introduction

In this guide, we will deploy a ZK Stack validium powered by Avail DA for secure, cost-efficient, and verifiable data availability. By following along, at the end of this guide, you will have a version of a ZK Stack chain running on your machine on `localhost`.

After executing the following commands you will have installed all the prequisites needed and also have cloned the `zksync-era` repository.

Installation commands are based on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**:
> The below instalation commands are taken from [setup-dev.md](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/blob/main/docs/guides/setup-dev.md) from the `zksync-era` repository. For any more troubleshooting, please refer to the original repository.

## Installing & running the ZK Stack


### 1. Installing ZK Inception

ZK Inception creates and manages Elastic Chain ecosystem and ZK chains using the ZK stack. To install `zk_inception` from git, run the following command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/ --locked zk_inception --force
```

### 2. Clone the zksync-era repository from github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era
```

- Checkout to branch that is worked on for DA clients:
    
```bash
git checkout dz-sync-layer-da-clients
```

- Change directory to Era `contracts`:

```bash
cd contracts
```

- Install submodules in the contracts directory:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive 
```

- Checkout branch `dz-upd-da-contracts` in contracts folder:

```bash
git checkout dz-upd-da-contracts
```
### 3. Add custom chain logic
Looking back, we have successfully installed `zk_inception` and cloned the `zksync-era` repository. We have also checked out branch on the main `zksync-era` repository and another branch in the `contracts/` folder. Now, we can add our custom chain logic in files `/contracts/LayerNameL1DAValidator.sol` and `/contracts/LayerNameL2DAValidator.sol`. 

You may also rename these two files, but you will have to change all instances of the old name in the code. These instances are in these files:

```bash
/contracts/da-contracts/contracts/da-layer/LayerNameL1DAValidator.sol
/contracts/l2-contracts/contracts/data-availability/da-layers/LayerNameL2DAValidator.sol
/contracts/l1-contracts/src.ts/deploy.ts
/contracts/l1-contracts/src.ts/deploy-process.ts
```

- Run the following command:

```bash
./bin/zkt
```

### 4. Running the containers

- We can start running the containers and ecosystem by first cleaning the docker containers and then running the following command:

```bash
zk clean --all
```

Now, we are ready to start DB and Reth containers using `zk_inception`. The great thing about this is that `zk_inception` handles everything on its own. If you encounter any errors, just make sure your ports are not busy and the `observability` feature is disabled during container setting up.

```bash
zk_inception containers
```

### 5. Initialize Elastic Chain ecosystem 

- We need to create an Elastic Chain ecosystem now. We will choose all the default options.
```bash
zk_inception ecosystem init
```

- Once we have successfully initalized an elastic chain ecosystem, we can create new chains and can choose to create a Validium when prompted. For simplicity, we will choose the default options.

```bash
zk_inception chain create
```

- Once we have created the chain, we have to finally initialize it and deploy the contracts of the ZK chain:
    
```bash
zk_inception chain init
```

- Now that the contracts have been deployed, we just need to go to the chain's general config and add our own config that we may need for any specific usecase. You can get these here:

```bash
zksync-era/chains/$CHAIN_NAME/configs/general.yaml
```

### 6. Run ZK chain
Finally, you just need to start the server which will be running the ZK chain. By default, it will be running on `localhost:3050`.

```bash
zk_inception server --chain $CHAIN_NAME
```

Your ZK chain is now running and you can start using it. For any troubleshooting or issues, please refer to the original repository which you can find [here](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/running-a-zk-chain/quickstart).
