# How to register your own `AppID` on Avail DA?

The easiest way to set up your own `AppID` on Avail DA is to use our [online AppID generator](https://appid.availproject.org/).

## Check the next available `AppID`

<Callout type="info">
Each `appID` consists of 3 fields:

- `key`: This is a string that is the name of the `appID`. Each `appID` should have a unique name.
- `owner`: This is the address of the account that created the `appID`. A single address can create multiple `AppIds`.
- `id`: This is the unique integer index of the `appID`. It is incremented by 1 everytime a new `appID` is created. Whenever a new
`appID` is created, it is automatically assigned the next available `id`.
</Callout>

1. Go to [appid.availproject](https://appid.availproject.org/) and select the correct network from the dropdown.
2. Click on `Search` and you will see a list of already existing `AppIDs` on the network.

> If you choose to create a new `AppID`, it's `id` will be the next integer in the sequence.

## How to register my own `AppID`?

1. You need to connect an Avail DA account to the website. Click on `Connect wallet` to do so.

<Callout type="info">
If you don't have an Avail DA wallet, you can follow our docs on [setting up a new wallet](/docs/end-user-guide/accounts#creating-an-account-on-avail-da).
</Callout>

2. Once connected, simply give your `AppID` a name, click on `Create AppID` and approve the transaction in your wallet to create the `AppID`.

## A few more things of note

1. As stated earlier, an the `key` and `id` fields of every `AppID` are unique. This means if you try to create an `AppID` with the same `key` as an existing one,
the operation will fail.

2. If you're a developer and are looking for more programmatic instructions, you can check out our [API reference](/api-reference/avail-node-api/da-create-application-key).
