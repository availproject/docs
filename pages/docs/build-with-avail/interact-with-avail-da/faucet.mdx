# How to Use the Testnet Faucet

The Avail testnet faucet will be living at [faucet.avail.tools](https://faucet.avail.tools/) for the forseeable future.
As of now, this is the only officially supported faucet for Avail DA.

<Callout type="info">
PLEASE NOTE<br/>
The faucet is designed to distribute small amounts of AVAIL for testing purposes, not large quantities for validator bonding or similar activities.
The current maximum balance a requesting address can have is 100 AVAIL.
</Callout>

## How to Use the Faucet

1. Create a Substrate account using a compatible wallet.
We recommend [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/), [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), or [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/).

2. Go to [faucet.avail.tools](https://faucet.avail.tools/).

3. Choose the chain you want to receive your tokens on. The default option will be `Turing`.

4. Enter the address where you want to receive your `AVAIL`. The address will begin with `5`.

5. You might see a captcha when trying out the faucet in production. Complete the captcha to get your tokens.

And that's it. You should receive a small amount of AVAIL in your account shortly.
