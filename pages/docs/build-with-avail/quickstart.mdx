# Get Started with Avail DA

This page aims to provide a quick overview of some of the most fundamental concepts a new developer needs to understand
to get started with Avail DA, and get started as quickly as possible.

## Setting up a new wallet

We have a page dedicated to help new devs & users to set up their first wallet on Avail DA. \
You can go through [our docs on the same](/docs/end-user-guide/accounts#creating-an-account-on-avail-da), or move on to the next section if you already have a wallet.

<Callout type="info">
**A FEW WORDS ABOUT YOUR SEED PHRASE**<br/>
1. Your seed phrase can be used to gain access to all of your accounts, and consequently, all of your funds. So keep it safe :)
2. It is a good idea to maintain seperate accounts with seperate seed phrases for different purposes, i.e. one for development, one for holding funds, etc.
3. With that being said, keep your seed phrase handy for this guide, we will use it later on.

## AppIDs

Avail DA is a neutral data availability layer that allows many different types of rollups/blockchains/apps to
be built on top of it, while leveraging Avail's decentralised ecosystem and financial security.

We envision all of these applications to operate with their own identity, symbolised by an `AppID`.

<Steps>

### Consider a random block on Avail DA

It might contain data blobs from a variety of different rollups pertaining to their different execution environments.
Think of the EVM, the SVM, Stackr, ZKsync chains, OP stack, and many more. \
If all of this data is randomnly strewn about in a block, it would be tedious for an a rollup to parse through all of it
just to fetch the data it needs.

<br/>
<p align="center">

</p>

### Now think of the same data neatly arranged into its own sections

But what if all of that same data in the same block was organised into different sections,
stored alongside it's peers. Each of these *'sections'* would be identified by an `AppID`. \
A developer now does not need to parse through the entire block to find the data they need, they can simply query data from the `AppID` they are interested in.

<img src="/img/quickstart/quickstart-app-id-2.png" alt="random data arranged neatly in Avail DA block" width="100%" />
</p>

### These *'sections'* are flexible

All of the rollups running on Avail DA probably won't submit data in all of the blocks. Thus, it is likely some `AppIDs` will be empty in some blocks. \
On the flipside, some rollups might need to submit more data than usual in a particular block. \
None of this is an issue on Avail DA, the individual block builds as needed in the moment.

**START WORKING WITH APPIDS**<br/>
There are many different ways of creating and using an `AppID` on Avail DA.

1. You can check out a more detailed breakdown of `AppIDs` and how to work with them using the AvailApps explorer
[on this page](/docs/end-user-guide/app-id#introduction).

2. Alternatively, you can check out programmatic instructions for the same [in our API reference](/api-reference/avail-node-api/da-create-application-key).

## The Avail Light Client

You typically interact with blockchains in 1 of 2 ways:

1. **Run your own node**: This way is trustless but also requires you to run a full node, which can be resource intensive.
2. **Rely on node providers**: This way is easier, but you have to trust the node provider.

> Avail DA gives you a third way.

Using the Avail light client, you can fetch data from and submit data to Avail DA without any trust assumptions or the need to run a full node.
You can run the Avail Light Client in the app-client mode by passing an `AppID` as a param.
Your light client wil then listen to the Avail DA network for each new block created, and fetch transactions
only for the `AppID` you are interested in. \
You can also submit data to the network under that `AppID` using the light client.

### Running the Avail Light Client

1. [Availup](https://github.com/availproject/availup) is the most convenient way to run the Avail Light Client. 
You are also welcome to clone the source code and build it locally from the [avail-light](https://github.com/availproject/avail-light)
repository.

2. Create a file named `identity.toml` somewhere in your system, and fill it as such:

```toml
avail_secret_seed_phrase = 'Please enter your own 12-word seed phrase here'
```

3. You can now run your own instance of the Avail Light client in the `app-client` mode by running:

```bash
curl -sL1 avail.sh | bash -s -- --network turing --app_id 87 --identity identity.toml
```
> Replace `87` with the `AppID` you are interested in.

4. If everything goes well, you should see something like this in your terminal:

<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="/img/quickstart/quickstart-light-client-1.png" alt="Avail light client running in app client mode" width="100%" />
</p>

<Callout type="info">
1. The Light client will now listen to the Avail DA network for each new block created, and fetch transactions only for the `AppID` you are interested in, in our case `87`.
2. The default local port is `7007`, you can check if you can access the Light client API by running the following command:
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:7007/v1/latest_block"
```
3. You can check out a detailed API reference for the Avail Light Client [in our API reference](/api-reference/avail-lc-api)

## Data submission on Avail DA

Submitting data forms the very core of building on top of Avail DA. If you really think about it, any app/rollup
running on Avail DA is essentially just submitting it's own data to the network periodically.
Avail DA does not execute the data in any way, just guarantees it's availability via validity proofs.

You can use call the `dataAvailability_submitData` extrinsic manually to submit new data to the network.
> Check out our [API reference](/api-reference/avail-node-api/da-submit-data) for a detailed breakdown.

We will however use our locally running Avail Light Client to submit data to the network.

- Open a new terminal on your system, and run the following command:

```bash
curl -XPOST 127.0.0.1:7007/v2/submit --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"data":"dGVzdAo5"}'
```

- You have thus submitted new data to Avail DA, under the `AppID` of `87`. The response will include a `blockHash`
that you can use to navigate to your submission on the network. It should look something like this:
