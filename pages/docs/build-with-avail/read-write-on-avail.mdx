# Read & Write data on Avail DA

We need to have a dedicated page to explain how to read and write data on Avail DA.
This is one of the most requested pieces of content from our devs.

While we do have examples for submitting data under the API reference, they seem to be insufficient on their own.
Also we need to have examples on reading data, which doesn't necessarily fall under the API reference.
