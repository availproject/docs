## Verify data availability on Ethereum

In order to verify data availability on Ethereum it is necessary
to first submit data to Avail as a data submission transaction. Data
submitted this way will be included in Avail blocks, but not
interpreted or executed in any way. The submission can be done using
`avail-js-sdk` which is a collection of tools for communication withAvail chain.

Complete example can be found on [github](https://github.com/availproject/avail/blob/example/main/avail-js/examples/node-examples/src/validium.ts).

To submit the data to Avail, extrinsic `availApi.tx.dataAvailability.submitData(data);` should be created with the `data` that will be submitted.
Once the transaction is included in an Avail block and block finalized the `data root` is generated for this block, and bridged to the
Ethereum network. Bridging to avail network is done every 360 Avail blocks and the commitment included in the VectorX contract.
VectorX is an implementation of zero-knowledge proof circuits for Vector, Avail's Data Attestation Bridge in [SP1](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-vector).


Deployed VectorX contract for Turing testnet on the Sepolia testnet: `0xe542db219a7e2b29c7aeaeace242c9a2cd528f96`.

Deployed VectorX contract for Avail mainnet on the Ethereum network: `0x02993cdC11213985b9B13224f3aF289F03bf298d`.

When the data root is bridged to the Ethereum network, it is possible to query for the inclusion proof using the `bridge-api`
deployed for Turing testnet `https://turing-bridge-api.fra.avail.so` and mainnet `https://bridge-api.avail.so`.
Detail documentation can be found ([here](https://github.com/availproject/bridge-api/blob/main/README.md)) .

By submitting proof to the verification contract it is possible to verify
that data is available on Avail. Merkle proof is a list of hashes that can be used to prove
that given leaf is a member of the Merkle tree. Example of submitting a proof to the bridge verification contract
deployed on Sepolia network for Turing ([`0x967F7DdC4ec508462231849AE81eeaa68Ad01389`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x967F7DdC4ec508462231849AE81eeaa68Ad01389))
and Ethereum mainnet ([`0x054fd961708d8e2b9c10a63f6157c74458889f0a`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x054fd961708d8e2b9c10a63f6157c74458889f0a))
can be done by calling `verifyBlobLeaf` function.
This will call deployed contracts function `verificationContract.verifyBlobLeaf(merkleProofInput)`
and return `true` or `false` depending on the provided proof.
