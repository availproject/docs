# How to Create and Manage an Avail Account

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through two different ways of creating an account on Avail, while also providing insights into the account specifications and formats.

### Seed Phrases

Before creating an account, it's essential to understand [<ins>seed phrases</ins>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet). During the account creation process, you'll receive a seed phrase—a series of words that can be used to recover your account.

SEED PHRASE SECURITY<br/>

NEVER EVER share your seed phrase with anyone and keep it in a secure location. Anyone with access to your seed phrase can gain control of your account.

## Creating an Account on Avail DA

In this guide, we will walk you through two different ways of creating an account on the Goldberg testnet of Avail DA.

1. **Using a compatible wallet**: You can create an account on the Goldberg testnet by using wallets like
[SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/), [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/) and others.
This guide will be using Subwallet as an example.

2. **Using the Goldberg Testnet Explorer**: Advanced users can also create an account on the Goldberg testnet straight from the explorer.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Please note that Avail DA is a modular blockchain built on top of the Substrate framework. due to how Substrate works,
the exact on-chain address of your account may vary from one chain to another.
Make sure to always double-check the address you are using. Avail addresses, for example will always begin with the number **`5`**.

#### What is the JSON File?

The JSON file serves as a backup for your account and contains all the necessary information to recover it. It is encrypted with a password that you set during the account creation process.
