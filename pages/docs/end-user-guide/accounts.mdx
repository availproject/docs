# How to Create and Manage an Avail Account

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through two different ways of creating an account on Avail, while also providing insights into the account specifications and formats.

**[<ins>Skip to Creating an Account on the Goldberg Testnet</ins>](#creating-an-account-on-avail-da).**

### Address Specifications & Format

Built on the Substrate framework, Avail leverages its robust and flexible account system to provide users with a secure and efficient way to manage their digital assets and identity.

Avail addresses are encoded in the [<ins>SS58 format</ins>](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/address-formats/), an enhanced version of [<ins>base-58 encoding</ins>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-to-text_encoding). This format offers several advantages, such as shorter and more identifiable addresses and network-specific prefixes. For a detailed technical explainer, refer to the [<ins>Substrate documentation on Accounts, Addresses, and Keys</ins>](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/accounts-addresses-keys/).

### Avail JS Apps: Your Interface to Avail

[<ins>Avail JS Apps</ins>](https://goldberg.avail.tools/#/explorer), a fork of [<ins>Polkadot JS Apps</ins>](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer), serves as your primary interface for the Avail network. Currently, its focus is solely on the Goldberg testnet, and as such, it is also referred to as the **Goldberg Testnet Explorer**. The scope of Avail JS Apps will expand as Avail matures into a production-ready network.

Avail JS aims to offer functionalities similar to those found in the [<ins>Polkadot-JS UI guide</ins>](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadotjs-ui), including but not limited to:

- **Accounts**: Create, manage, and recover accounts.
- **Staking**: Engage in network staking and manage validators.
- **Explorer**: Browse blockchain data, view block details, and monitor network activity.

### Seed Phrases

Before creating an account, it's essential to understand [<ins>seed phrases</ins>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet). During the account creation process, you'll receive a seed phrase—a series of words that can be used to recover your account.

SEED PHRASE SECURITY<br/>

NEVER EVER share your seed phrase with anyone and keep it in a secure location. Anyone with access to your seed phrase can gain control of your account.

## Creating an Account on Avail DA

In this guide, we will walk you through two different ways of creating an account on the Goldberg testnet of Avail DA.

[PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/), [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), or [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/).
This guide will be using Subwallet as an example.

2. **Using the Goldberg Testnet Explorer**: You can also create an account on the Goldberg testnet straight from the explorer.

2. Subwallet will prompt you to set up a password to secure access to the accounts in the wallet. Please note that this password

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Please note that Avail DA is a modular blockchain built on top of the Substrate framework. due to how Substrate works,
the exact on-chain address of your account may vary from one chain to another.
Make sure to always double-check the address you are using. Avail addresses, for example will always begin with the number **`5`**.

5. Upon completion, a JSON file containing your account information will be downloaded to your file system. You may be prompted to grant browser permissions for the download.

#### What is the JSON File?

The JSON file serves as a backup for your account and contains all the necessary information to recover it. It is encrypted with a password that you set during the account creation process.

> Backup and Recovery
Always keep your JSON file in a secure and offline location. Losing this file and your password could result in the loss of your assets.
