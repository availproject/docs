# How to Create and Manage an Avail Account

## Introduction

This guide will walk you through two different ways of creating an account on Avail, while also providing insights into the account specifications and formats.

### Seed Phrases

Before creating an account, it's essential to understand [<ins>seed phrases</ins>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet). During the account creation process, you'll receive a seed phrase‚Äîa series of words that can be used to recover your account.

SEED PHRASE SECURITY<br/>

NEVER EVER share your seed phrase with anyone and keep it in a secure location. Anyone with access to your seed phrase can gain control of your account.

## Creating an Account on Avail DA

In this guide, we will walk you through two different ways of creating an account on Avail DA.

1. **Using a compatible wallet**: You can create an account by using wallets like
[SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/), [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/), [Nova Wallet](https://novawallet.io/) and others.
This guide will be using Subwallet as an example.

2. **Using the Explorer**: Advanced users can also create an account straight from the explorer.

1. Go to [Subwallet.app](https://www.subwallet.app/) and install their browser extension. Once installed,
you should se a few different options to get started. We will create an account from scratch, although you can import
existing accounts too.

2. Subwallet will prompt you to set up a password to secure access to the accounts in the wallet. Please note that this password
**DOES NOT** control the actual on-chain account, and is merely used to open the wallet extension.
<br/>
<img src="/img/subwallet/subwallet_2.jpeg" width="100%" height="100%" />

3. Next, read through and agree with all of Subwallet's conditions to get the Seed Phrase of tour Avail account.

4. You will be shown your seed phrase. **Make sure to write it down and store it in a safe place**.
<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
Please note that this seed phrase is exposed only one time at the time of account creation by Subwallet.
Make sure to store it in a safe place as it is the only way to recover your account.

<br/>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
Please note that Avail DA is a modular blockchain built on top of the Substrate framework. due to how Substrate works,
the exact on-chain address of your account may vary from one chain to another.
Make sure to always double-check the address you are using. Avail addresses, for example will always begin with the number **`5`**.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="‚ö†Ô∏è">
UPDATE METADATA<br/>
Sometimes when the chain undergoes upgrades, the underlying metadata within your wallets/extensions may become outdated.
Not updating them might result in transaction signatures failing.
You can update your metedata, if needed, using the [AvailApps explorer](https://explorer.avail.so/#/settings/metadata).
