# What do AppIds mean on Avail DA?

## Introduction

As a general-purpose base layer, Avail is designed to support many
modular chains at the same time, providing consensus and data
availability to all of them simultaneously.

How does this work? Avail headers contain an index that allows a given
modular chain (or "application" in Avail terminology) to determine and
download _only_ the sections of a block that have data for that
particular application.

This has significant benefits, including:

- Modular applications are mainly unaffected by other uses of the
  base layer at the same time.

- Block sizes can increase without requiring applications to fetch
  more data because they don't need to fetch the whole block, only what's
  relevant to them. \
  This filtering is done using the "application id" (AppId).

Data availability sampling is still done on the entire block,
however--this is the process where clients sample tiny parts of
the block at random to verify availability.

## Tell me more

Let's learn more about AppIds by going through a real-life example.

<Callout type="info">
1. We recommend you go through the whole page before trying to go through the same steps.

2. Although there are multiple ways to retrieve existing AppIds and generate new ones, using the [Avail DA explorer](https://explorer.avail.so/#/chainstate) to do so
is a good way to start.

3. The [Avail DA explorer](https://explorer.avail.so/#/) is very powerful and can be used in a variety of ways.
For now though, let's stick to `AppIds`.
</Callout>

1. Make sure you're on the `chain state` section of the explorer. You can access it by [simply clicking this link](https://explorer.avail.so/#/chainstate),
or by navigating to it through the `developer` tab near the top right.

2. Make sure you've selected the `dataAvailability` pallet and the `appKeys` method.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-1.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

3. Uncheck the `include option` toggle, and click on the `+` button next to the method name.
You will fetch a list of all registered `AppIds` on Avail DA.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-2.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

Each `appID` consists of 3 fields:

- `key`: This is a string that is the name of the `appID`. Each `appID` should have a unique name.
- `owner`: This is the address of the account that created the `appID`. A single address can create multiple `AppIds`.
- `id`: This is the unique integer index of the `appID`. It is incremented by 1 everytime a new `appID` is created. Whenever a new
`appID` is created, it is automatically assigned the next available `id`.

4. Next, check the `include option` toggle, and enter `based avail` as the `bytes` input. Call the function. What do you see?
You will be returned a pair of `owner` and `id`, which together with the `key` you entered, form a unique `appID`.

<br/>

</div>

<Callout type="info">
1. The `appKeys` method is essentially a mapping that returns the `owner` and `id` of an `appID` given its `key` (`key` => (`owner`, `id`)).
2. By checking the `include option` toggle, you are essentially filtering the output.
</Callout>

## How to check the next available `appID`?

Anyone can create their own `appID` on Avail DA. The process is entirely democratic ðŸ˜…, and it's rather simple too.

Let us first check out the next available `appID` on the newtork.

1. Within the `dataAvailability` pallet, select the `nextAppId` method.
No need to pass any params, just click the `+` button next to the method name.

2. You will be returned the next available `index`/`id` for a new `appID`.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-4.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

## How to register my own `appID`?

1. Make sure you have one or more Avail DA wallets connected to the explorer. If you don't know how to do so,
you can follow our docs on [setting up a new wallet](/docs/end-user-guide/accounts#creating-an-account-on-avail-da).

2. Simply [click this link](https://explorer.avail.so/#/extrinsics) OR navigate to the `extrinsics` section of the explorer through the `developer` tab.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that the `Developer` tab does not show the `extrinsics` section at all if you don't
have a wallet set up on the explorer or an extension wallet connected to it.
So make sure you have an [Avail DA wallet set up](/docs/end-user-guide/accounts) before moving forward.
</Callout>

3. Select the `dataAvailability` pallet, and the `createApplicationKey` method.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-5.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

4. Enter a `key` for your `appID`. It can be anything you like, really.

5. This is how it should look like in the end:

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-6.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

6. Click on `Submit Transaction`, and then click on `Sign and Submit` in the box that pops up.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/app-ids/app-id-6.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

<Callout type="info">
**DO NOT CHANGE THE `appID` FOR THIS TRANSACTION**<br/>

1. Each and every single transaction on Avail DA has a unique `appID` associated with it.
2. A transaction or data submission with the `appID` of `0` is used for chain-level operations.
3. This is what we need to use for creating a new `appID`, since it has nothing to do with a specific '*app*' on Avail DA.
4. This field would instead have been a positive integer if we, for example, were submitting data to a specific application on Avail DA.
</Callout>

7. Authorise the transaction through your wallet, and you're done! You've successfully created your own `appID` on Avail DA.

8. You can verify `7` by using the steps covered earlier to query the `appKeys` method :)

## A few more things of note

1. As stated earlier, an the `key` and `id` fields of every `appID` are unique. This means if you try to create an `appID` with the same `key` as an existing one,
the operation will fail. This is why it makes sense to use the `appKeys` method to check if your desired name is already taken.

2. If you're a developer and are looking for more programmatic instructions, you can check out our [API reference](/api-reference/avail-node-api/da-create-application-key).

3. **Anyone can submit any sort of data to any `appID` regardless of whether or not they created it.** \
*But what does this mean? And is this an attack vector?*

- This is where it is important to understand that Avail DA is a DA layer, not an execution enviornment.
We are not concerned with the validity of the data being submitted, only with its availability, which means we can support a wide variety of applications across multiple tech stacks.
- This does not constitute an attack vector since that any app or execution layer building on top of Avail DA can always set up
certain rules to filter out unwanted data submissions.
- They could for example make it so that only data submitted with a particular signature, i.e. from a particular address, is accepted.
All other data submitted to the particular `appID` is treated as spam, and ignored.
