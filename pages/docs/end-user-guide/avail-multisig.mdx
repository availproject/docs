# Set up a multisig wallet on Avail DA

You can use the [avail-apps](https://explorer.avail.so/#/accounts) explorer to set up and start using a multisig wallet on Avail DA.
This guide will show you how to do so.

<Callout type="info">  
**PREREQUISITES** <br/>
The only prerequisite is that you have access to two or more Avail DA accounts.
Refer to our docs on [setting up an Avail wallet](/docs/end-user-guide/accounts) for moredetails if needed

## Create a multisig wallet on Avail DA

<Steps>

### Start setting up the multisig

Go to [avail-apps](https://explorer.avail.so/#/accounts), and click on `Multisig`. This will give you a UI interface
that will allow you to configure your multisig wallet.

<Callout type="info">
DOUBLE CHECK<br/>
Please note that a multisig account created on one network won't be created automatically on another. This
tutorial is based on he Turing testnet, but will work just as well for Avail DA mainnet too.
</Callout>

### configure the multisig

1. Select all the signatories you want to include in the multisig wallet.
2. Select the `threshold` value for the multisig. It represents the minimum number of addresses that need to approve a transaction
for it to be executed. A `threshold` value of `2` in our case would mean that any `2` of the `3` signatories can perform
a transaction from the multisig.
3. Choose an appropriate name for the multisig.
4. Click on `Create`.

the multisig's address before proceeding.

## Use a multisig wallet on Avail DA

<Steps>

### Create a transaction to transfer funds

You should now be able to see your new multisig account created under a seperate category on the
[accounts page](https://explorer.avail.so/#/accounts). Click on `send` to start creating a new transaction.
Enter the recipient and the amount to transfer, and click on `Make Transfer`.

### Sign and submit the transaction

You will now be able to sign a `balances.transferKeepAlive` transaction from the multisig account.
This extrinsic allows you to transfer funds from one account to another.

1. A transaction for a multisig can only be created via an approved signatory. Choose one from the `multisig signatory`
dropdown.

<Callout type="warning">
PLEASE NOTE<br/>
You can only sign a transaction for the multisig from the signatory accounts you have access to.
If you don't have access to an authorised signatory, you can't create, approve, or reject a transaction
for the multisig.
</Callout>

2. Copy the hexadecimal value of the `multisig call data`. This value will be needed later on.

3. Make sure that the `sign and submit` on the bottom-left option is checked. Finally, click on the `Sign and Submit`
button on the bottom right.

<br/>

### Execute the transaction

You will now see a pink icon next to your multisig wallet that indicates a pending transaction. Click on 'View Pending Transactions'
to take a look.

<br/>

1. Our `threshold` value was set at `2`, and we already have one approval in form of the signatory that originally created
the transaction.

2. Thus, an approval by just one more authorised signatory will execute the transaction that will
transfer <br/>`10 AVAIL` to the recipient.

3. Paste the `multisig call data` you copied in the second step into the empty column.

4. Click on `Approve`.

<br/>

5. Click on `Sign and Submit`.

<br/>
<img src="/img/multisig/multisig-pic-7.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

6. Depending on how you have connected the signatory account to the `avail-apps` UI (ledger seed phrase, wallet extension),
you might have different transaction approval interfaces. But once you approve it, funds should be successfully transferred from the multisig wallet.
