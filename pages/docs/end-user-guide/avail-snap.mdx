# Use Avail DA with Metamask

## Introduction

Metamask is one of the most popular wallets for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains out there.
Metamask Snaps is an open source system that allows developers to create a custom '*Snap*'
that can be installed into a user's Metamask wallet to extend it's functionality for different chains.

You can check out [Metamask website](https://metamask.io/snaps) and [Metamask docs](https://docs.metamask.io/snaps/) for more information.

The Avail snap will allow you to easily interact with Avail DA from within your Metamask wallet.
We are actively working on adding more features to the Avail Snap, so stay tuned for updates.

### Use the Avail Snap

<Callout type="info">
  The Avail Snap generates an address for you based on the seed phrase embedded into your
  Metamask wallet. Thus, if you transfer the same wallet to a new system and install
  the Avail Snap again, you will derive the same address.
