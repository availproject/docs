# How to Use the Testnet Faucet

The Avail testnet faucet will be living at [faucet.avail.tools](https://faucet.avail.tools/) for the forseeable future.
As of now, this is the only officially supported faucet for Avail DA.

<Callout type="info">
PLEASE NOTE<br/>
The faucet is designed to distribute small amounts of AVL for testing purposes, not large quantities for validator bonding or similar activities.
The current maximum balance a requesting address can have is 100 AVL.
</Callout>

## How to Use the Faucet

1. Create a Substrate account using a compatible wallet.
We recommend [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/), [Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/), or [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/).

2. Go to [faucet.avail.tools](https://faucet.avail.tools/).

3. Complete the captcha, enter your account address, and click on `Get AVLs`.

And that's it. You should receive a small amount of AVL in your account shortly.
