# How to use a ledger wallet on Avail DA

Avail DA is a modular blockchain built for the next generation of rollups by being an effective and efficient
solution for the [data availability problem](https://blog.availproject.org/data-availability-what-is-it/).

The AVAIL token is the native token of the Avail DA, used to perform basic transactions, as well as to submit data.
It therefore becomes crucial to store your AVAIL tokens securely, especially for wallets with large amounts of them.

This guide will take you through verifying, rejecting, and approving a transaction on Avail DA using a Ledger wallet.

## Prerequisites

1. A ledger device. Refer to [ledger's official website](https://www.ledger.com/) for the same.
2. The Avail app for ledger should be installed on your ledger device. You can do so by downloading the
[ledger live app](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) on your computer or mobile and use it to install the Avail app on your ledger.

<Callout type="warning">
If you're using a new ledger device, it is highly recommended to ensure it's firmware is up to date before anything else.
You can update it's firmware using the ledger live app.

## Open the Avail app on your ledger device

<Callout type="info">
Please note that you will need to have the Avail app open on your ledger device to interact with Avail DA in any capacity.

This is what your ledger device should display when the Avail app is opened:

2. Click on `From Ledger`.

3. A form will pop up. Give your derived account a random name.
4. Choose a top-level and a second-level derivation for your account. We'll be going with `0` and `0` respectively.
<br/>

<Callout type="info">
Any account address generated from your ledger will be a unique combination of your ledger-device's
seed phrase, the top-level derivation, and the second-level derivation.
This means if you re-connect to the avail apps explorer with the same ledger device in the future (that has not been reset), and use
the same top-level and second-level derivations, you will get the same account address.
</Callout> 

5. This is what the accounts tab should look like after you've derived a hardware account:

6. Make sure to send some AVAIL to this account to interact with Avail DA.

## Sign a transaction on Avail DA using your ledger device

1. Click on the `send` button alongside your ledger wallet.
2. Enter a recipient's address and an amount to send.
3. Click on `Make Transfer`.
4. Make sure the app id is `0` if you're performing a simple transaction.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that non-zero app ids are used to submit data to Avail DA.
For all top-level/simple transactions, the correct app id is `0`.
</Callout>

5. Click on `Sign and Submit`.
6. At this point the explorer UI will wait for a signing/rejection of the transaction from your ledger device.
7. You can verify important details of the transaction from your ledger device, including the destination address and the amount of AVAIL being transferred.
This is what it should look like:

8. Once you are done verifying, `Approve` or `Reject` the transaction using the buttons on your ledger device.
9. Once the transaction has been finalised, you will see a success message on the explorer UI:
