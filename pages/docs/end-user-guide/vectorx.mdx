# Bridge AVAIL to Ethereum using the VectorX bridge

## Introduction

The Avail team has been hard at work in partnership with [Succinct labs](https://succinct.xyz/)
to develop a trust-minimized bridge between Avail DA and Ethereum.

> Enter VectorX.

VectorX uses zkSNARKs to enable an efficient and trust-minimized bridge to pass arbitrary messages
between Avail DA and Ethereum, which enables use cases like token bridging.
You can read about VectorX in more detail on [Succinct's blog](https://blog.succinct.xyz/vector-x/).

This is a non-technical tutorial focussed on actually using the bridge via a convinient web interface built by Avail.

## Using the Bridge

<Callout type="warning">
BEFORE YOU BEGIN<br/>
You need to manually claim your AVAIL tokens on either of the chains, once they've been bridged.
This means you'll also need a small amount of ETH on Ethereum mainnet to pay for the gas fees to call the `claim`
function on the AVAIL ERC-20 contract.<br/>
Please keep this in mind and have some ETH ready on the EVM wallet address that you connect to the bridge.

<Steps>

### Go to the official `avail-bridge` UI

Go to [bridge.availproject.org](https://bridge.availproject.org/), and then connect an Avail wallet,
and an EVM wallet to the website.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that this is required because Avail DA and Ethereum use two different address formats.
The funds on Ethereum will be claimable only by the EVM address you connect here.

### Initiate the bridging, and wait!

Bridging AVAIL from Avail DA to Ethereum typically takes 1-2 hours.
You can check the `Transactions` tab in the UI to see the status of your transaction.
Wait for the transaction status to change to `Claim Ready`.

### Claim your funds

You will need to manually claim `AVAIL` on Ethereum with the same EVM address you connected earlier. used in `step 1`.
Click on `Claim Ready` and approve the transaction in your wallet.
Your AVAIL tokens on Ethereum mainnet will then be transferred to your account.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that you are executing a transaction on Ethereum in this step, so you will need to have some ETH in your wallet to pay for the gas fees.

This exact process can be reversed to bridge AVAIL from Ethereum to Avail DA.
