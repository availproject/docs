# Governance on Avail

We at Avail are committed to establishing an open and transparent system of governance that encourages community participation
and empowers all stakeholders to have a say in the future of Avail.

Avail's governance will gradually decentralize over time, and all details will be documented here as we move forward.
For now, this page will explain in detail the initial phase of governance that will roll out alongside [Avail DA mainnet](/docs/introduction-to-avail/avail-da).

## Outline

The goal during this phase is to establish the initial governance structure for enabling technical contributions from 
the Avail community.

This phase includes the following:

- Outline Avail's governance values.
- Establish the process for community members to propose technical changes to the Avail network.
- Establish the Avail Technical Committee.
- Establish **Avail Enactment Reports (AER)**: A simple summary used to communicate upcoming or executed 
changes made to the Avail DA Network.
- Establish the role of the Avail community forum for community governance.

## Our governance values

- **Secure**: The safety and security of the users should always be the top priority for the Technical Committee, 
and its decisions should reflect that commitment.
- **Transparent**: The Technical Committee is committed to transparency and accountability in its actions and 
decision-making processes. To this end, Avail Enactment Reports (AERs) are published on the community forum to inform 
the community of the Committee's activities and upcoming changes.
- **Lean**: The goal for the initial phase of community governance is to be agile and easy for the community to understand 
and participate in.
- **Fair**: The Committee is responsible for ensuring that all proposals submitted are evaluated fairly and without bias. 
This is essential to maintaining trust and confidence in the Committee and its decision-making processes whilst keeping 
social consensus as decentralized as possible.

In addition to these critical responsibilities, the Committee may look for ways to improve and enhance the network. 
This includes working closely with the community to identify areas for improvement and implementing changes to 
address these issues.

## Submitting governance proposals


1. Create a proposal using this template.

2. Proposals can be submitted:
    - by the community on the Avail forum.
    - by the Technical Committee, either through a majority or unanimously.

### What happens next?

Submitted proposals will go through the following process:

1. **Community Discussion:** This is a chance for the community to discuss the pros and cons of the proposal.
2. **Proposals with Social Consensus get submitted to the Technical Committee:** Proposals that garner high social support or show interesting merits to the network will be forwarded to the Technical Committee by a Governance Facilitator. All activities and proposal updates by the Governance Facilitator can be tracked in the open on the community forum.
3. **Onchain Voting:** If the proposal is accepted, it will be queued for execution. An Avail Enactment Report (AER) will be submitted to the community forum and there will be a 3-day execution window before the changes are finally executed. If the proposal does not achieve a majority consensus from the Technical Committee, it will be canceled.

### A note on fast tracked changes

The technical committee can fast track certain critical upgrades which require a fast turn around, such as resolving critical vulnerabilities. 
To maintain transparency, AERs will be submitted after the changes have been implemented to protect any sensitive 
information and so the community has visibility over fast tracked changes that take place. 

A fast tracked change follows a simple yet secure governance process that requires the Technical Committee to reach a supermajority consensus of â‰¥ 4/5.

## The technical committee

The Technical Committee consists of 5 on-chain members who operate using multi-sig contracts and vote on proposals.
The multisig composition takes into consideration several parameters such as member responsiveness, technical competence, 
social connections, reputation, OpSec practices, geographic diversity and voice from different work streams.

The current technical committee members are:


| **Committee Member**     | **Workstream**  | **Address**       |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------|
| **Anurag**               | Founder         |   5               | 
| **Prabal**               | Founder         |   5               |
| **Marko**                | Node management |    5              |
| **Jakub**                | Engineering     |   5               | 
| **Toufeeq**              | Substrate       |       5           |

## Avail Transparency Reports (ATR)

ATRs are simple summaries of upcoming or executed changes made to the Avail Network.

ATRs include:

- The proposed changes
- Code (where necessary)
- Potential merits to the network
- Resources (If any)

ATRs will be posted on the Avail Community Forum.

Given the sensitivity of fast tracked proposals, ATRs will be posted for community transparency on the forum after 
the changes have been made.

## Roll of the Avail community forum

The Avail Community Forum serves as the central hub within the Avail ecosystem, promoting collaboration among community
members, developers, validators, committee members, and projects utilizing Avail.

It offers a platform for exchanging ideas and discussions related to the Avail network and its technology.
