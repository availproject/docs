# Governance Phase 1 Overview

This is the initial phase of Avail's governance. This initial phase provides the community with a clear way to propose, 
discuss and keep up to date with changes to the Avail network. 
It seeks to provide the Avail community with a meaningful way to discuss, propose and 
challenge network upgrades while ensuring that malicious actors cannot dominate the network.

The initial governance framework has been put in place with the release of Avail DA on mainnet, and will continue to evolve with the network over time. 


## Outline

The goal during this first phase is to establish the initial governance structure, so the Avail community can propose on-chain upgrades to the Avail network.

Avail Governance V1 includes the following:

- Establish the role of the Avail community forum for community governance and coordination.
- Establish Avail Improvement Proposals (AIPs) a simple way for community members to propose on-chain upgrades.
- Establish Avail Transparency Reports (ATRs), a summary used to communicate upcoming or executed upgrades made to the Avail DA Network.
- Establish the Avail Technical Committee and their role in on-chain governance.
- Outline Avail's Technical Committee values.

## Role of the Forum

The Avail forum is a place where anyone including developers, validators, community members, and projects utilizing Avail can discuss and propose changes to the Avail Network. 

## Governance Process 

The Avail Forum is also used to discuss changes to Avail and the Avail Improvement Proposal
(AIP) process lays out a formal way to request changes. General discussions about potential 
changes to the network take place on the forum where you can request feedback from the 
community prior to writing and submitting an AIP.

## The AIP Process

The AIP process for regular changes is very simple, and can be understood via this diagram:

**AN IMPORTANT NOTE ON EMERGENCY CHANGES**<br/>
The technical committee can fast track certain critical upgrades in case of an emergency, such as resolving a critical vulnerability. In order to maintain transparency, ATRs will be submitted after the changes have been implemented and deployed to protect any sensitive information, and so the community has visibility over emergency changes that take place.
