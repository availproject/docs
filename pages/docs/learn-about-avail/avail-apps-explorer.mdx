# Get started with the Avail Apps Explorer

The Avail network has two main explorers that can be used to browse the network:

1. [Avail Apps explorer](https://explorer.avail.so/): A dev-focussed explorer with powerful tools to work with the network.
2. [Subscan explorer](https://avail-turing.subscan.io/): A simpler, and also the recommended way to explore the network for most users.

This tutorial will focus on helping advanced users and devs get started with the Avail Apps Explorer.

## The basics

### Switch networks

The Avail Apps explorer currently supports [Avail mainnet](https://mainnet.explorer.availproject.org/) and [Avail Turing testnet](https://turing.explorer.availproject.org/).

To switch networks:

1. Click on the `Network name` on the top-left.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-1.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

2. Depending on the network you are on, click on `live networks -> Avail DA network`, or `test network -> Avail Turing testnet`.

3. Click on `Switch`.

<br/>

</div>

### Look up the details of a particular transaction with the block number

1. Search for the `block number` or `block hash` of the block your transaction was included in.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-3.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

2. The explorer then fetches all transactions from that specific block. Click on the hash of the transaction you are interested in to get a detailed view.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-4.png" align="center" />
</div>

### Look up the details of a particular transaction without knowing the block number

1. Due to how the network is designed, it is not possible for any explorer to directly look up a transaction's details using it's hash.

2. It is therefore not supported in the search feature.

3. However, the [Subscan explorer](https://avail.subscan.io/) allows you to directly search for transactions since it queries from a dedicated indexer
built on top of Avail to support exactly this feature.

## The `Accounts` section

This section can be used to add or import Avail accounts into the explorer.

To go to the page, click on the `Accounts` tab on the top-left, or click [this link](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/accounts).

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-5.png" align="center" />
</div>

You can do a few things here:

1. Create a new account using a `mnemonic` or by clicking on the `+ Account` button.
2. Import an account via an encrypted JSON file.
3. Connect extension accounts from wallets like `Polkadot.js`, `Subwallet`, `Talisman`, etc...
4. Create a multisig account. We have covered instructions to do so [in our docs here](/user-guides/avail-multisig).
5. Create a proxy account. We have covered instructions to do so [in our docs here](/user-guides/avail-proxy).
6. The `AvailApps` explorer also allows you to use hardware wallets to safely connect cold accounts. We have covered
instructions to do so [in our docs here](/user-guides/ledger-avail).

> Any of these accounts that you connect can be used to sign transactions on the network. Which is something we will cover in the next section.

## Using the explorer to interact with the network

Wrt interacting with the network, the `AvailApps` explorer can be used to:

1. Query data from the network by calling `Chain State` or `RPC` methods.
2. Send transactions to the network by signing and submitting `Extrinsics`.

You can find them within the `Developer` tab.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-6.png" align="center" />
</div>


<Callout type="info">
**WHAT ARE PALLETS?**<br/>
Avail organizes its runtime functionality into `pallets`. Each pallet is a collection of calls and extrinsics of a specific functionality. 
For example, the `data_availability` pallet contains all the calls and extrinsics related to querying and submitting data to the network, and so on.
Some methods might be grouped into seemingly unrelated pallets for technical reasons, but this largely holds true.

To look for a particular method within the `AvailApps` explorer, you need to know the pallet it belongs to.
</Callout>

### How to use the explorer to query the network

Let us learn how to query the network using the `AvailApps` explorer by querying the balance of an account.
1. Either go to the `Chain State` methods menu from within the `Developer` tab or click [on this link](https://explorer.avail.so/#/chainstate).

2. The balance of an account can be queried by calling the `account(AccountId32)` method from within the `system` pallet. Select the `system`
pallet from the dropdown on the left, and the `account(AccountId32)` method from the dropdown on the right.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-7.png" align="center" />
</div>

<Callout type="info">
**THE `include option` TOGGLE**<br/>
This toggle allows you to enter params for a method when it is toggled on.
You can also call methods without passing a param by keeping it off. \
But `system_account` method won't return anything without an `AccountId32` param being passed to it, so we will keep it on. \
**Hot tip:** Try calling the `dataAvailability_appKeys` method with the `include option` toggle off to see what happens.
</Callout>

3. Either paste the address of an account in the `AccountId32` field or select an explorer-connected account from the dropdown.

4. Leave the `blockhash` field empty (This will query the latest balance of the account), and click on the `+` button near the top-right.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-8.png" align="center" />
</div>

5. And that's it. You just used the `AvailApps` explorer to query the balance of an account on the Avail network. You can query other methods in a similar way.


### How to use the explorer to send transactions to the network

You can also use the `AvailApps` explorer to sign custom transactions/extrinsics and submit them to the network.
We have covered different examples of doing so in our docs. Here is one of them:

[Submit data to a particular `AppID` by submitting a `dataAvailability_submitData` extrinsic](/docs/learn-about-avail/app-ids#how-to-submit-data-to-my-appid).

### Bonus: How to query chain constants using the explorer

1. The `AvailApps` explorer allows you to query the current values of all of it's runtime constants by going to the constants tab within
`Developer -> Chain State`.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-9.png" align="center" />
</div>

2. For example, to query the current value of the `existentialDeposit` of an account on Avail, which is the minimum amount required by an
account to exist on the network, you can call the `balances_existentialDeposit` constant.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-10.png" align="center" />
</div>

> P.S: The balance displayed is in `attoAVAIL`. 1 `attoAVAIL` = $10^{-18}$ `AVAIL`.

3. You can look up any other constant in a similar way.

## Wrapping up

The `AvailApps` explorer is a powerful and comprehensive tool that allows a wide variety of users to interact with the network in their required ways.
We did not even touch on the `staking` and `governance` related functionalities that it offers.

We will update this page with more examples and information as we go along.
