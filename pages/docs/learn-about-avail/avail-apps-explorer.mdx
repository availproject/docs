# Get started with the Avail Apps Explorer

The Avail network has two main explorers that can be used to browse the network:

1. [Avail Apps explorer](https://explorer.avail.so/): A powerful dev-focussed tool with powerful tools to work with the network.
2. [Subscan explorer](https://avail-turing.subscan.io/): A simpler, and also the recommended way to explore the network for most users.

This tutorial will focus on helping advanced users and devs get started with the Avail Apps Explorer.

## The basics

### Switch networks

The Avail Apps explorer currently supports [Avail mainnet](https://mainnet.explorer.availproject.org/) and [Avail Turing testnet](https://turing.explorer.availproject.org/).

To switch networks:

1. Click on the `Network name` on the top-left.

</div>

2. Depending on the network you are on, click on `live networks -> Avail DA network`, or `test network -> Avail Turing testnet`.

3. Click on `Switch`.

### Look up the details of a particular transaction with the block number

1. Search for the `block number` or `block hash` of the block your transaction was included in.

<br/>
<div align="center">
<img src="/img/new-explorer/new-explorer-3.png" align="center" /> 
</div>

2. The explorer then fetches all transactions from that specific block. Click on the hash of the transaction you are interested in to get a detailed view.

</div>

### Look up the details of a particular transaction without without knowing the block number

1. Due to how the network is designed, it is not possible for any explorer to directly look up a transaction's details using it's hash.

2. It is therefore not supported in the search feature.

3. However, the [Subscan explorer](https://avail.subscan.io/) allows you to directly search for transactions since it queries from a dedicated indexer
built on top of Avail to support exactly this feature.
