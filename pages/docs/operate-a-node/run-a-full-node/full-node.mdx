# How to Run an Avail node


## How to run an Avail node 

There are two main ways of running an Avail node:

1. By running a pre-built binary.
2. By building from source
3. By running a pre-built image using Docker

<Tabs items={['Run a pre-built binary' , 'Build from source' , 'Using Docker']}>


<Tabs.Tab>

1. Go to the [Avail node GitHub releases page](https://github.com/availproject/avail/releases/).
There you will see a lot of pre-built binaries for each version of the Avail node.

2. Please download the binary suitable from your system, of the latest recommended version, which as of now is `v2.2.3.0-rc1`.
You can do this using the GUI or by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/availproject/avail/releases/download/v2.2.3.0-rc1/<YOUR-SYSTEM-SPECIFIC-BINARY>.tar.gz
```
3. Extract the downloaded file by opening a terminal in the location of the downloaded file and using the following command:

```bash
tar -xzvf <YOUR-SYSTEM-SPECIFIC-BINARY>.tar.gz
```

> Your terminal should now look something like this:
<br/>
<p align="center">
<img src="/img/node-binary-demo.png" alt="Extracted Avail node binary" width="95%"/>
</p>

- The file in red is what we downloaded to our system.
- The file in green is the extracted binary.

4. Once extracted, you will see a pre-built, executable binary named `avail-node` in the same directory.
You can run this binary using the following command:

```bash
./avail-node --name a-random-name --chain turing -d ./output
```

5. Your terminal output should look something like this:

<Callout type="info">
Please note that the following instructions were tested specifically on an Ubuntu machine. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.
However, they should work on all Debian installations, and with minor tweaks, on all Linux distros.
</Callout>

Before proceeding, install the required dependencies:

1. The Rust toolchain: Go to [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions to install the Rust toolchain onto your system.
Verify Rust is installed on your system by running:
```bash
rustc --version
```

<Callout type="info">
If the installation process seemed to go smoothly and the command above still doesn't work:
1. Close your current terminal and try it in a new one.
2. Alternatively, in your old terminal, run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` and then run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` again.
</Callout>

If you still encounter issues with Rust's installation, refer to the [Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for troubleshooting tips.

2. Make sure your Linux distro is up-to-date by running:
```bash
apt update && apt upgrade
```

3. Make sure some common dependencies are installed using:
```bash
apt install make clang pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential git curl llvm libudev-dev cmake protobuf-compiler -y
```

<Callout type="info">
Some of these commands might not work without being prefixed by 'sudo'.
However, the 'sudo' command gives the terminal root access, so be careful
when using it.
</Callout>

4. Clone the Avail node repo and move your terminal into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/availproject/avail.git && cd avail
```

5. Build the Avail node by executing this command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```
<Callout type="info">
The build process may take some time, depending on your system's specifications.
On a system with a Quad-core processor & 8GBs of RAM, the build process typically takes 
around 35-40 minutes.
</Callout>

6. Once your Avail node is compiled locally, you can run it using:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --name a-random-name --chain turing -d ./output
```

7. Your terminal output should look something like this:

```bash

<Callout type="info">

1. This part of the guide assumes you have [Docker engine installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
on your system. 

2. You can quickly check if it is installed by running:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```

3. It is recommended to run Docker without using the 'sudo' command.
Check out [these post-installation instructions in Docker's docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to do so.

</Callout>

To download and run an Avail node using Docker:

1. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker run --restart=on-failure -d -v /root/avail/node-data:/da/node-data -p 9944:9944 -p 30333:30333 docker.io/availj/avail:v2.2.3.0-rc1 --chain turing -d ./output --name a-random-name
```
- -d runs the container in the background
- -v  mounts a volume into the container
- -p publishes containers port to the host machine

2. To configure Docker specific flags you can refer to Docker's documentation,
and you can check out the Additional configs section in this page to get more information
on how to configure the Avail node.

3. To a persistent output from the container, you can run:

```bash
docker logs -f <container_id>
```
