# How to Run an Avail node


## How to run an Avail node without Docker

There are two main ways of running an Avail node without Docker:

1. By building from source
2. By running a pre-built binary.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that the following instructions were tested specifically on an Ubuntu machine. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.
However, they should work on all Debian installations, and with minor tweaks, on all Linux distros.
</Callout>

Before proceeding, install the required dependencies:

1. The Rust toolchain: Go to [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and follow the instructions to install the Rust toolchain onto your system.
Verify Rust is installed on your system by running:
```bash
rustc --version
```

<Callout type="info">
If the installation process seemed to go smoothly and the command above still doesn't work:
1. Close your current terminal and try it in a new one.
2. Alternatively, in your old terminal, run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` and then run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` again.
</Callout>

If you still encounter issues with Rust's installation, refer to the [Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for troubleshooting tips.

2. Make sure your Linux distro is up-to-date by running:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

3. Make sure some common dependencies are installed using:
```bash
sudo apt install make clang pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential git curl llvm libudev-dev cmake protobuf-compiler -y
```

4. Clone the Avail node repo and move your terminal into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/availproject/avail.git && cd avail
```

5. Build the Avail node by executing this command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```
<Callout type="info">
The build process may take some time, depending on your system's specifications.
On a system with a Quad-core processor & 8GBs of RAM, the build process typically takes 
around 35-40 minutes.
</Callout>

6. Once your Avail node is compiled locally, you can run it using:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --name a-random-name --chain turing -d ./output
```

7. Your terminal output should look something like this:

```bash

1. Go to the [Avail node GitHub releases page](https://github.com/availproject/avail/releases/).
There you will see a lot of pre-built binaries for each version of the Avail node.

2. Please download the binary suitable from your system, of the latest recommended version, which as of now is `v2.1.1.0-rc1`.
You can do this using the GUI or by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/availproject/avail/releases/download/v2.1.1.0-rc1/your-system-specific-binary.tar.gz
```
3. Extract the downloaded file by opening a terminal in the location of the downloaded file and using the following command:

```bash
tar -xzvf x86_64-ubuntu-2204-avail-node.tar.gz
```

4. Once ext
./avail-node --name a-random-name --chain turing -d ./output
</Tabs.Tab>

Your node will also appear on the [Avail Telemetry site](https://telemetry.avail.so/), listed under the "Node name" from the node command output.
Be sure to select the appropriate network tab at the top to view your node's status.

## How to Run an Avail Node with Docker

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running a full node on the Avail network using Docker. Whether you're new to node operation or have prior experience, this guide is designed to make the setup process straightforward.

<Callout type="info">
BEFORE YOU START<br/>
**Ensure that you meet the [<ins>system requirements</ins>](/docs/operate-a-node/run-a-full-node/requirements).** We recommend downloading the pre-compiled binary for speed and convenience.
</Callout>

### Step 1: Launch Your Avail Node

To launch your Avail node, navigate to the `/mnt/avail` directory and execute the following Docker command:

```bash
cd /mnt/avail
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/state:/da/state:rw -p 30333:30333 -p 9615:9615 -p 9944:9944 -d --restart unless-stopped availj/avail:v1.10.0.0 --chain goldberg --name "MyAweasomeInContainerAvailAnode" -d /da/state
```

> The Docker command performs several important steps:

> - Map the state directory, providing read-write permissions for data persistence.
> - Opens various ports for different functionalities, including P2P connections, metrics, and HTTP RPC.
> - Utilizes the Avail image from Docker Hub and sets it to restart unless manually stopped.

### Step 2: Verify Node Functionality

#### Inspect Node Logs

To confirm that your node is operating as expected, inspect the Docker logs by running the following:

```bash
ubuntu:/mnt/avail# docker ps
ubuntu:/mnt/avail# docker logs 5b3978de8f35  # 5b3978de8f35 is the container id
```

#### Monitor Your Node

You can monitor the status of your node on the [<ins>Avail Telemetry</ins>](http://telemetry.avail.tools/) website.
