# Technical Committee

The Technical Committee consists of 7 members which can perform both Emergency and Regular actions. For on-chain actions to be deployed, they must be signed for on-chain by 5/7 Technical Committee members. The Technical Committee will have more members from the community and will introduce voting parameters in the upcoming Governance phases.

The composition of the Technical Committee takes into account several parameters such as member responsiveness, technical competence, social connections, reputation, OpSec practices, geographic diversity and voice from different work streams.

The technical committee members are:

## Technical Committee Values

- **Secure**: The safety and security of the users should always be the top priority for the Technical Committee, and its decisions should reflect that commitment.
- **Transparent**: The Technical Committee is committed to transparency and accountability in its actions and decision-making processes. To this end, Avail Transparency Reports (ATRs) are published on the community forum to inform the community of the Committee's activities and upcoming changes.
- **Lean**: The goal for the initial phase of community governance is to be agile and easy for the community to understand and participate in.
- **Fair**: The Committee is responsible for ensuring that all proposals submitted are evaluated fairly and without bias. This is essential to maintaining trust and confidence in the Committee and its decision-making processes whilst keeping social consensus as decentralized as possible.

In addition to upholding these core values, the Technical Committee seeks to work with the community to identify areas for improvement and implement upgrades.
