BEFORE WE PROCEED<br/>
Please note that:
1. **No Avail employee will EVER** reach out to ask you for your private keys/seed phrases.
2. There is only one official claims portal, and that is [`claim.availproject.org`](https://claim.availproject.org). Any other website claiming
to be an official/unofficial/affiliated claims portal cannot be trusted.
