BEFORE WE PROCEED<br/>

1. **No Avail employee will EVER** reach out to ask you for your private keys/seed phrases.
2. There is only one official claims portal, and that is [`claim.availproject.org`](https://claim.availproject.org). Any other website claiming
to be an official/unofficial/affiliated claims portal cannot be trusted.
3. Check your eligibility by going to the Avail Claims Portal, accepting the [Avail Mainnet Terms & Conditions](https://avail-project.notion.site/Avail-Mainnet-Ts-Cs-adab514839a74022a61bbfb3e3a6f548) and the supplemental [Airdrop Terms & Conditions](https://avail-project.notion.site/Avail-Mainnet-Airdrop-T-Cs-a3c5b27bbc62444ebcff55d6aaa20359) as well as following the claims process.
