# Avail's Unification Drop

BEFORE WE PROCEED<br/>
Please note that:
1. **No Avail employee will EVER** reach out to ask you for your private keys/seed phrases.
2. **No Avail employee will EVER** ask you for *'a small amount of money'* in return extra rewards.
3. There is only one official claims portal, and that is `claim.availproject.org`. Any other website claiming
to be an official/unofficial/affiliated claims portal is a scam.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR THE UNIFICATION DROP<br/>
Please note that this page will walk you through how to claim your AVAIL tokens from the unification drop,
but our [unification drop blog announcement](https://blog.availproject.org/avails-unification-drop-claim-your-genesis-avail-now/) is the only source of truth for the eligibility criteria.
