We believe this sets us up to build a community that enables every blockchain - whether L1, L2, app chain, or new constructs we havenâ€™t yet seen - to keep scaling.

We will keep this page updated with the latest information.

## AVAIL powers web3's unification layer

The Avail Unification Layer consists of Avail DA, Nexus and Fusion which together form a unification layer for web3 
that addresses blockchain scalability, interoperability and security. AVAIL is a key part of the Avail Unification 
Layer used in Avail DA, Nexus and Fusion.

If you want to read about these in more detail, you can refer to [our blog](https://blog.availproject.org/avail-the-token-powering-blockchain-unification/#avail-powering-the-unification-layer).
