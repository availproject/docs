## AVAIL allocation

AVAIL's allocation was designed from the ground up keeping the community and long-term growth in mind.
Over 65% of the AVAIL token allocation will be dedicated to the community through the Public Allocation (12%), Ecosystem Development (30%), and Community & Research (23.25%) categories.

The exact percentages of the AVAIL token allocation are:

üßë‚Äçüßë‚Äçüßí‚Äçüßí Public Allocation: **12%** <br/>
üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Ecosystem Development: **30%** <br/>
üë®‚Äçüîß Community & Research: **23.25% <br/>**
üíº Investors (Seed & Series A): **14.75%** <br/>
üë®‚Äçüíª Early Contributors: **20%** <br/>
<br/>

We believe this sets us up to build a community that enables every blockchain - whether L1, L2, app chain, or new constructs we haven‚Äôt yet seen - to keep scaling.

We will keep this page updated with the latest information.
