Please note that:
1. **No Avail employee will EVER** reach out to ask you for your private keys/seed phrases.
2. **No Avail employee will EVER** ask you for *'a small amount of money'* in return extra rewards.
3. There is only one official claims portal, and that is `claim.availproject.org`. Any other website claiming
to be an official/unofficial/affiliated claims portal is a scam.
