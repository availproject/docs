# Moving out locked `AVAIL` tokens from a Polkadot ledger account


## What's the problem?

1. The `Avail` ledger app derives a different set of addresses as compared to the `Polkadot` ledger app for the same seed phrase.
2. This means while the addresses derived on the `Polkadot` ledger app will work on `Avail`, the `Polkadot` ledger app will not allow users to sign transactions on the `Avail` network.
3. To solve this problem we have created the `Avail recovery` app for ledger devices.
4. This new app will derive the same set of addresses as the `Polkadot-ledger` app and allows users to sign transactions on the `Avail` network, thus giving users access to these funds.

**LOOKING FOR INSTRUCTIONS WITH DIFFERENT WALLETS?**<br/>
1. The following set of instructions are written using subwallet.
2. But you can use any other wallet that supports ledger devices just as well.
3. We also have a guide for [setting up a ledger account with Talisman in our docs here](/user-guides/ledger-avail#add-your-ledger-account-to-an-extension-wallet)

## How to use the `Avail recovery` app?

<Steps>

### Make sure the `Avail recovery` app on your ledger device using the Ledger live app.

**NOTE:**<br/>
The `Avail recovery` app is available on the ledger live app only in the `Developer mode`.

1. Go to `My Ledger` section, and find the settings ⚙️ icon on the top right section.
2. Head to `Experimental Features` and switch on `Developer Mode`.
3. Move back to `My Ledger`, and search `Avail Recovery` in the search bar.

**NOT ABLE TO SELECT YOUR ACCOUNTS?**<br/>
1. It is important to remember that the `Avail recovery` app will derive the same set of addresses as the `Polkadot` ledger app to give you access to your funds.
2. This means if your wallet already has that same ledger address connected via the `polkadot` ledger app, you will not be able to import it once again via the `avail recovery` app.
3. To get around this, you can temporarily delete the polkadot ledger address from your wallet and then re-add it via the `avail recovery` app.
4. This does not remove the address from your ledger device, just disconnects it from your wallet.
5. Now you should be able to import the same address via the `avail recovery` app.
