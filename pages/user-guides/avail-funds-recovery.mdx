# Moving out locked `AVAIL` tokens from a Polkadot ledger account


## What's the problem?

1. The `Avail` ledger app derives a different set of addresses as compared to the `Polkadot` ledger app for the same seed phrase.
2. This means while the addresses derived on the `Polkadot` ledger app will work on `Avail`, the `Polkadot` ledger app will not allow users to sign transactions on the `Avail` network.
3. To solve this problem we have created the `Avail recovery` app for ledger devices.
4. This new app will derive the same set of addresses as the `Polkadot-ledger` app and allows users to sign transactions on the `Avail` network, thus giving users access to these funds.

**LOOKING FOR INSTRUCTIONS WITH DIFFERENT WALLETS?**<br/>
1. The following set of instructions are written using subwallet.
2. But you can use any other wallet that supports ledger devices just as well.
3. We also have a guide for [setting up a ledger account with Talisman in our docs here](/user-guides/ledger-avail#add-your-ledger-account-to-an-extension-wallet)
