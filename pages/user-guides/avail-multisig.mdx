# Set up a multisig wallet on Avail DA

You can use the [avail-apps](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/accounts) explorer to set up and start using a multisig wallet on Avail DA.
This guide will show you how to do so.

<Callout type="info">  
**PREREQUISITES** <br/>
The only prerequisite is that you have access to one or more Avail DA accounts.
Refer to our docs on [setting up an Avail wallet](/docs/end-user-guide/accounts) for more details if needed
</Callout>


## Create a multisig wallet on Avail DA

<Steps>

### Import the signatory accounts

You need to import into the explorer all the accounts you want added as signatories to the multisig.

There are two ways to do this:

<Tabs items={['Via address book', 'Import a json file']}>

<Tabs.Tab>
1. Go to the [`addresses`](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/addresses) page of the explorer.
2. Click on `Add contact` and save any addresses you want.
</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
1. Create a json file with all the Avail DA addresses you want to import.
The syntax is as follows:

```json
[
    "add1",
    "add2",
    "add3"
]
```

2. Save the file. This will be of use later.

<Callout type="info">
This method is suitable if you have a large number of addresses to import.
</Callout>

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

### Start setting up the multisig

Go to the [accounts page of the avail-apps explorer](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/accounts), and click on `Multisig`. This will give you a UI interface
that will allow you to configure your multisig wallet.

<Callout type="info">
DOUBLE CHECK<br/>
Please note that a multisig account created on one network won't be created automatically on another. This
tutorial is based on he Turing testnet, but will work just as well for Avail DA mainnet too.
</Callout>

### Configure the multisig

1. Select all the signatories you want to include in the multisig wallet.
You can do so either by:
    - Importing addresses from your address book, or,
    - by uploading the json file outlined in `step 1`.
2. Select the `threshold` value for the multisig. It represents the minimum number of addresses that need to approve a transaction
for it to be executed. A `threshold` value of `2` in our case would mean that any `2` of the `3` signatories can perform
a transaction from the multisig.
3. Choose an appropriate name for the multisig.
4. Click on `Create`.

</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
**BUT WHAT OF OTHER SIGNATORIES?**<br/>
An obvious question that pops up is how will other signatories import the multisig wallet into the avail-apps
explorer on their own machine?<br/>
Due to the way the `multisig` pallet works on Avail DA, a multisig derived from the same set of addresses and the same `threshold` value
will always have the same address.
Thus, all signatories can simply create a multisig on their machine with addresses of all the other signatories along with a constant `threshold value` to derive the same '*multisig address*'.
Alternatively, a single json file with all signatories can be created and shared among all signatories.

The next steps will take you through using your multisig wallet for the first time. Please send some tokens to
the multisig's address before proceeding.

## Use a multisig wallet on Avail DA

<Steps>

### Create a transaction to transfer funds

You should now be able to see your new multisig account created under a seperate category on the
[accounts page](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/accounts). Click on `send` to start creating a new transaction.
Enter the recipient and the amount to transfer, and click on `Make Transfer`.

<br/>
<img src="/img/multisig/multisig-pic-3.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

### Sign and submit the transaction

You will now be able to sign a `balances.transferKeepAlive` transaction from the multisig account.
This extrinsic allows you to transfer funds from one account to another.

1. A transaction for a multisig can only be created via an approved signatory. Choose one from the `multisig signatory`
dropdown.

<Callout type="warning">
PLEASE NOTE<br/>
You can only sign a transaction for the multisig from the signatory accounts you have access to.
If you don't have access to an authorised signatory, you can't create, approve, or reject a transaction
for the multisig.
</Callout>

2. Copy the hexadecimal value of the `multisig call data`. This value will be needed later on.

3. Make sure that the `sign and submit` on the bottom-left option is checked. Finally, click on the `Sign and Submit`
button on the bottom right.

<br/>
<img src="/img/multisig/multisig-pic-4.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

### Approve and/or execute the transaction

Now that a transaction has been created, other signatories have the choice to either:

1. Approve the transaction, or,
2. Reject the transaction.


You will see a pink icon next to your multisig wallet that indicates a pending transaction. Click on 'View Pending Transactions' to take a look.
Click on `approval type` to simply approve or reject the transaction.

<br/>
<img src="/img/multisig/multisig-pic-7-1.png" width="100%" height="100%" />


1. Our `threshold` value was set at `2`, and we already have one approval in form of the signatory that originally created
the transaction.

2. Thus, an approval by just one more authorised signatory will execute the transaction that will
transfer <br/>`10 AVAIL` to the recipient.

But what if you simply want to approve the transaction without executing it? Avail DA's multisig implementation
allows for this functionality too.
Let us say you are the final signatory whose approval will mean the transaction has enough approvals
to be executed.<br/>
But you don't want to execute the transaction just yet. 

*You only want to approve it, and let some other signatory execute it later on.*

<Tabs items={['Approve', 'Approve and Execute']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

1. If a signatory wants to approve the transaction without executing it, they don't need the `multisig call data` value.

2. Make sure the `multisig message with call` button is unchecked, and click on `Approve`.

3. Then, click on `Sign and Submit` and execute the transaction.

<br/>
<img src="/img/multisig/multisig-pic-7-1-1.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

<Callout type="info">
**POINTS TO NOTE**<br/>
1. After the `threshold` value of minimum number of approvals has been met, any signatory can execute the transaction.
2. You cannot execute the transaction without the `multisig call data` value.
</Callout>

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

3. Paste the `multisig call data` you copied in the second step into the empty column.

4. Click on `Approve`.

<br/>
<img src="/img/multisig/multisig-pic-7-2.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

5. Click on `Sign and Submit`.

<br/>
<img src="/img/multisig/multisig-pic-7.png" width="100%" height="100%" />

6. Depending on how you have connected the signatory account to the `avail-apps` UI (ledger seed phrase, wallet extension),
you might have different transaction approval interfaces. But once you approve it, funds should be successfully transferred from the multisig wallet.

<Callout type="info">
Needless to say, you will, as a signatory, be able to execute the transaction only if you are the last signatory required to meet the `threshold` value.

Let us go through the same process as before, i.e., executing a transaction from our multisig wallet
to transfer funds, but using the `extrinsics` tab instead. */}
