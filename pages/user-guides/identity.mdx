# How to Set an On-Chain Identity

## Introduction

Avail allows you to set canonical on-chain identities for your accounts via the `identity_setIdentity` extrinsic.
Users need to lock a small account of `AVAIL` to set an identity, which is refunded if and when the identity is cleared.

The AvailApps explorer provides a convenient UI to set an identity for your account, which is what we will be doing in the
next section.

<Callout type="info">
1. The bond amount for registering an on-chain identity is currently **100 AVAIL**.
2. The bond amount for registering each sub-identity is **2 AVAIL**.
3. The maximum number of sub-identities per identity is **100**.

</div>

5. Click on `Sign and Submit` and approve the transaction.

6. The account will now have a registered on-chain identity which you can clear to recover the bonded AVAIL tokens.

<Callout type="info">
1. This UI interface calls the `setIdentity` method from the `identity` pallet under the hood.
2. Registering your identity on the Avail turing testnet does not set it for the mainnet, and vice versa.
