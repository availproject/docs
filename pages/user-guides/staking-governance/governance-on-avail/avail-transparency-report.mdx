# Avail Transparency Report

Avail Transparency Reports (ATR) are simple summaries of upcoming or executed changes made to the Avail Network.

ATRs include:

- The proposed changes
- Code (where necessary)
- Potential merits to the network
- Resources (If any)

ATRs will be posted on the [Avail Community Forum](https://forum.availproject.org/c/governance/avail-transparency-report/34) under the ATR sub-category in the Governance section. 

> *Given the sensitivity of emergency changes, ATRs will be posted for community transparency on the forum after the changes have been made.*
