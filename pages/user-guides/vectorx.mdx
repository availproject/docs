# Bridge AVAIL to Ethereum using the VectorX bridge

## Introduction

The Avail team has been hard at work in partnership with [Succinct labs](https://succinct.xyz/)
to develop a trust-minimized bridge between Avail DA and Ethereum.

> Enter VectorX.

VectorX uses zkSNARKs to enable an efficient and trust-minimized bridge to pass arbitrary messages
between Avail DA and Ethereum, which enables use cases like token bridging.
{/* You can read about VectorX in more detail on [Succinct's blog](https://blog.succinct.xyz/vector-x/). */}

This is a non-technical tutorial focussed on actually using the bridge via a convinient web interface built by Avail.

     <summary>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</summary>

1. Will my bridged tokens automatically appear in my wallet on the other side?
        - No.<br/>
        Your funds will take a couple of hours to bridge, following which you need to go to the bridge UI once again and manually
        claim your AVAIL tokens on the other side.

2. Which chain should I claim from?
        - The Avail bridge UI currently only supports bridging AVAIL tokens between Avail DA and Ethereum.
        If you initiate the bridging process from Avail DA and want to claim your AVAIL tokens on Ethereum, you need to go to `Transactions` tab and claim AVAIL by
        making sure your EVM wallet is connected to **Ethereum mainnet**, and clicking the `Claim Ready` button.
        Conversely, if you initiate the bridging process from Ethereum and want to claim your AVAIL tokens on Avail DA, 
        make sure your Avail wallet is connected to **Avail DA mainnet**, and click the `Claim Ready` button.

3. I am not able to claim tokens even though a lot of time has passed?
        - Please note that while users may be facing some bugs in the bridge UI, user funds are 100% safe will
        be claimable soon. We are working on brushing up the UI and will fix all the bugs soon.

4. Will I need funds on the chain where I am claiming my tokens?
        - Yes, since you're effectively executing a transaction on the chain where you're claiming your tokens.
        This means if you're bridging from Avail DA to Ethereum, you will need some ETH on Ethereum mainnet.
        On the other hand, if you're bridging from Ethereum to Avail DA, you will need some AVAIL on Avail DA mainnet.

5. What if I have submitted a `claim` transaction on the wrong network?
        - We have received some reports of an edge-case where it is possible for users to sign the claim transaction
        on an EVM network like `Avalanche` through our UI. Please note that this is a bug, and users should
        only sign transactions on Avail DA or Ethereum mainnet.
        If you have signed a transaction on the wrong network, you might need to clear the bridge UI's cache data
        in your browser.
        You can find instructions on how to clear cache for a particular website [in this blog](https://support.breezechms.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402756658839-Google-Chrome-Clearing-Cache-and-Cookies-for-Specific-Sites).

## Using the Bridge

<Callout type="warning">
BEFORE YOU BEGIN<br/>
You need to manually claim your AVAIL tokens on either of the chains, once they've been bridged.
This means you'll also need a small amount of ETH on Ethereum mainnet to pay for the gas fees to call the `claim`
function on the AVAIL ERC-20 contract.<br/>
Please keep this in mind and have some ETH ready on the EVM wallet address that you connect to the bridge.

<Steps>

### Go to the official `avail-bridge` UI

Go to [bridge.availproject.org](https://bridge.availproject.org/), and then connect an Avail wallet,
and an EVM wallet to the website.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that this is required because Avail DA and Ethereum use two different address formats.
The funds on Ethereum will be claimable only by the EVM address you connect here.
</Callout>
<br/>

</div>

### Initiate the bridging, and wait!

Bridging AVAIL from Avail DA to Ethereum typically takes 1-2 hours.
You can check the `Transactions` tab in the UI to see the status of your transaction.
Wait for the transaction status to change to `Claim Ready`.
<br/>

        <img src="/img/bridge-ui/claim-ready.png" width="80%" height="80%"/>
</div>

### Claim your funds

You will need to manually claim `AVAIL` on Ethereum with the same EVM address you connected earlier. used in `step 1`.
Click on `Claim Ready` and approve the transaction in your wallet.
Your AVAIL tokens on Ethereum mainnet will then be transferred to your account.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that you are executing a transaction on Ethereum in this step, so you will need to have some ETH in your wallet to pay for the gas fees.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
This exact process can be reversed to bridge AVAIL from Ethereum to Avail DA.

### Make sure you have a Ledger device ready

If you need instructions on how to get started with a ledger device, please refer to our docs.

1. [Set up a new ledger device](/user-guides/ledger-avail#set-up-your-ledger-from-scratch)
2. [Connect a ledger account to your Subwallet/Talisman extension wallet](/user-guides/ledger-avail#add-your-ledger-account-to-an-extension-wallet)

### Click on the `Connect` button in the Bridge ui & select your preferred wallet

</div>

### Select your ledger account from within your wallet

<Callout type="info">
1. Please note that you need to have the `Avail` app installed on your ledger device.
2. Your ledger device needs to be unlocked during the entire process.
</Callout>

<br/>
<div align="center">

</div>

### Fill out the rest of the details and click on `Approve`

1. Specify the amount of AVAIL you want to bridge.
2. Specify the destination address on the other chain, or simply connect an EVM wallet to the bridge UI.
3. Initiate the bridging process.
4. Click on `Approve` in the pop-up window. This will send the transaction to your ledger device.

### Approve the bridging transaction on your ledger device

1. Unlock your ledger device.
2. Approve the bridging transaction on your ledger device.
3. Wait for a while, and you should see a transaction confirmation message in the bridge UI.
