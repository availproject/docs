# How to Set an On-Chain Identity

## Introduction

Users of Avail DA can register their identites on-chain in exchange for a small bond.
<Callout type="info">
The bond amount for registering an on-chain identity is currently 100 AVAIL on both Turing and mainnet.
</Callout>
This bond is refundable upon the clearance of the identity. \
This guide will walk you through the process of setting an on-chain identity on the Avail network.

## Set Your On-Chain Identity

1. Go to the [accounts page of the Avail apps explorer](https://explorer.availproject.org/#/accounts).

2. Select the account whoe identity you want to set and click on `Set on-chain identity`.

All the fields are optional as long as any one of them are filled.

5. Click on `Sign and Submit` and approve the transaction.

6. The account will now have a registered on-chain identity which you can clear to recover the bonded AVAIL tokens.

<Callout type="info">
1. This UI interface calls the `setIdentity` method from the `identity` pallet under the hood.
2. Registering your identity on the Avail turing testnet does not set it for the mainnet, and vice versa.
</Callout>
